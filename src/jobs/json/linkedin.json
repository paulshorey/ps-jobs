Our company is self-funded and profitable, and has been entirely remote since we started in 2013.<br><br><strong>Our team<br></strong>Aha! engineering is a mid-sized, fully remote team that is highly productive. We are centered around North American time zones so we can collaborate during the workday.<br><ul><li><strong>We move quickly</strong>: We ship code multiple times a day. We believe in getting new features in front of customers and iteratively improving as we learn what works and what does not.</li><li><strong>We collaborate</strong>: We each bring unique experiences and skills to the table. Working together to share that knowledge benefits the entire team and helps us produce the best results for our customers.</li><li><strong>We value product over process</strong>: We want the team to have the time and focus to solve complex challenges.

It is a single-instance, multi-tenant Ruby on Rails monolith supported by Postgres (database), Redis (background jobs), and memcached (Rails caching). We also run a Node.js webserver to support collaborative editing and real-time updates. Our application is hosted on Amazon Web Services and architected with ECS for reproducibility and scalability.<br><br>We utilize a growing amount of React on the front end to build rich client-side experiences, including our fully collaborative text editor and our slide presentation editor. We balance the strengths of both technologies — Rails for its conventions and simplicity and React for more powerful interactive functionality.<br><br>We embrace new technologies that help us deliver a lovable product, but we also remain cognizant of the maintenance overhead that a new library or platform brings. We solve the problems in front of us rather than prematurely optimizing to address issues that may never materialize.<br><br>We do most of our collaboration and planning in Aha! itself, which we find especially rewarding. We also utilize GitHub, Slack, and GoToMeeting for video calls.<br><br><strong><u>Your Experience<br><br></u></strong>We believe that being a kind person who elevates the rest of the team is just as valuable as writing great code. You have strong problem-solving skills and experience working on important functionality for a cloud-based product. You are humble, eager to learn, and always willing to help others learn as well. You want to work with people who enjoy picking up a problem and solving it, regardless of the technologies and techniques involved.<br><br>Most of our features involve writing significant Ruby on Rails code, so you have meaningful past experience working in a Rails codebase. We also write a lot of React, but we are happy to help you learn that part on the job.<br><br><strong>Your work at Aha!<br></strong>We work on a broad range of features across the full stack. Your work will include:<br><ul><li>Implementing new features for our users, touching each layer of the MVC as needed</li><li>Building deeply interactive reporting interfaces using React</li><li>Working proactively with product and UX to refine and iterate on specifications as the feature takes shape</li><li>Investigating slow performance and optimizing queries to ensure Aha! is snappy and satisfying to use</li><li>Interfacing directly with users to quickly squash bugs as part of our regular customer support rotation </li><li>Documenting components in our style guide to help drive consistency<br><br></li></ul>If this sounds appealing, we would love to hear from you.

You will work on an interdisciplinary team spanning Engineering, Design, and Product to ensure Newsela continuously ships a product which will be used in K-12 schools nationwide. As a technical expert, you will be a key voice throughout the entire development process, including initial discovery (where you’ll be expected to empathize with the end-users and play an integral role in outlining the overall solution so that not only is the software performing as intended, but that adoption and usage follows suit). Your team will own a specific product feature, and have the opportunity to exercise long-term thinking to iterate on the product over time.<br><br><strong><u>Why You’ll Love This Role<br><br></u></strong>You will be part of a highly collaborative interdisciplinary team, and will own a user-facing part of Newsela’s product. This role gets you flexing your product and design skills, as well as your expertise in software development. You get to be part of a team that designs solutions as well as builds them; you will be shaping the product to ensure that beautifully designed features are shipped to Newsela’s national user base. As we scale, you’ll be releasing code daily. And because we're a technology company focused on improving the way students learn, you’ll be part of an engineering culture that values learning, teaching, and questioning.<br><br><strong><u>Why We’ll Love You<br><br></u></strong>You have 5+ years of professional full-stack web application development experience, and competency in our tech stack (Node.js, GraphQL, React). You practice lean and flexible software development, are familiar with kanban boards, and have demonstrated experience building in responsive design natively without a frontend framework (across mobile, tablet, and desktop). Ideally, you are very comfortable writing in Javascript against the browser’s native API.<br><br>In addition to your coding skills, you are able to work and communicate with design, engineering, data, and product teams to produce timely, healthy code. You can seamlessly illustrate concepts from a single function all the way to a system architecture, defend the intention of your solutions, and can explain the implications to technical and non-tech experts alike. You bring an informed point of view to your team, and pay as close attention to the clarity and maintainability of your code as you do its functionality.<br><br><strong><u>About Newsela<br><br></u></strong>Newsela is an Instructional Content Platform that combines engaging, leveled content with integrated formative assessments and insights to supercharge engagement and learning in every subject.

Critical data in the modern enterprise is often sprayed across a broad set of cloud systems (e.g. SaaS &amp; data infrastructure), and it’s a herculean task for security teams to monitor, manage, and protect this highly sensitive data. Via machine learning, our product makes it easy for companies to discover, classify, and protect this sensitive data across their cloud footprint - such as their corporate SaaS, data infrastructure, and APIs. In doing so, we prevent data leakage, provide unprecedented data visibility &amp; protection across the cloud, and enable compliance. We're a technology startup based in San Francisco and Palo Alto, well-funded by leading institutional investors with deep expertise in the cybersecurity industry.

We help more than 5,000 companies build lovable products and be happy doing it. Our company is self-funded and profitable, and has been entirely remote since we started in 2013.<br><br><strong>Our team<br></strong>Aha! engineering is a mid-sized, fully remote team that is highly productive. We are centered around North American time zones so we can collaborate during the workday.<br><ul><li><strong>We move quickly</strong>: We ship code multiple times a day. We believe in getting new features in front of customers and iteratively improving as we learn what works and what does not.</li><li><strong>We collaborate</strong>: We each bring unique experiences and skills to the table. Working together to share that knowledge benefits the entire team and helps us produce the best results for our customers.</li><li><strong>We value product over process</strong>: We want the team to have the time and focus to solve complex challenges. We aim to minimize the overhead introduced by heavyweight processes and excessive meetings.</li><li><strong>We are happy</strong>: it is important to us that you love your job and are happy at work. Learn more about our company <u>values</u> . Check out our generous <u>benefits</u> .</li><li><strong>We enjoy</strong>: We like what we do. And we want you to love your job too. Learn more about The Responsive Method , our company values , and the generous benefits we offer. <br><br></li></ul><strong>Our technology<br></strong>Our sole product is the Aha! web application. It is a single-instance, multi-tenant Ruby on Rails monolith supported by Postgres (database), Redis (background jobs), and memcached (Rails caching). We also run a Node.js webserver to support collaborative editing and real-time updates. Our application is hosted on Amazon Web Services and architected with ECS for reproducibility and scalability.<br><br>We utilize a growing amount of React on the front end to build rich client-side experiences, including our fully collaborative text editor and our slide presentation editor. We balance the strengths of both technologies — Rails for its conventions and simplicity and React for more powerful interactive functionality.<br><br>We embrace new technologies that help us deliver a lovable product, but we also remain cognizant of the maintenance overhead that a new library or platform brings. We solve the problems in front of us rather than prematurely optimizing to address issues that may never materialize.<br><br>We do most of our collaboration and planning in Aha! itself, which we find especially rewarding. We also utilize GitHub, Slack, and GoToMeeting for video calls.<br><br><strong><u>Your Experience<br><br></u></strong>We believe that being a kind person who elevates the rest of the team is just as valuable as writing great code. You have strong problem-solving skills and experience working on important functionality for a cloud-based product. You are humble, eager to learn, and always willing to help others learn as well. You want to work with people who enjoy picking up a problem and solving it, regardless of the technologies and techniques involved.<br><br>Most of our features involve writing significant Ruby on Rails code, so you have meaningful past experience working in a Rails codebase. We also write a lot of React, but we are happy to help you learn that part on the job.<br><br><strong>Your work at Aha!<br></strong>We work on a broad range of features across the full stack. Your work will include:<br><ul><li>Implementing new features for our users, touching each layer of the MVC as needed</li><li>Building deeply interactive reporting interfaces using React</li><li>Working proactively with product and UX to refine and iterate on specifications as the feature takes shape</li><li>Investigating slow performance and optimizing queries to ensure Aha! is snappy and satisfying to use</li><li>Interfacing directly with users to quickly squash bugs as part of our regular customer support rotation </li><li>Documenting components in our style guide to help drive consistency<br><br></li></ul>If this sounds appealing, we would love to hear from you.

Join us in our mission to make website development fun by making it simple.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>About Us</strong></p><p>Gatsby is a remote-first, community-focused team working to build a high-performance, fun to use, accessible, and astonishingly flexible presentation layer for any data source (think: Wordpress, Markdown files, you name it). Our core values include transparency (our work is public most of the time); creating a safe, high-trust team; building incredible developer experiences; maintaining a healthy working environment; and helping deliver web experiences that feel amazing to use on every device and connection type.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Details of the Role</strong></p><ul><li>Type of Work: Full-time employee</li><li>Location: Remote<em> (preference for UTC-8 to UTC+4 time zones)</em></li><li>Engineering Level: L4-L5 (see our Engineering Levels Guide)</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Why we’re hiring</strong></p><p>You may know Gatsby, the open-source project, which currently is downloaded 800k+ times/month, has nearly 40K github stars, and a thriving community of 2.5K (and growing) contributors. We’re building incredible Cloud tooling to make the open-source product faster, better, and easier to use for teams. As we scale this product, we’ll have more and more customers--with widely varied technical skill--using our Cloud offerings. To maximize and maintain engineering velocity, we need a skilled engineer to pinpoint customer issues, drive product improvements to eliminate entire types of issues, and above all else, ensure customers succeed beyond their wildest dreams in their usage of Gatsby.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why this is interesting</strong></p><p>Our Customer Success team works closely with <strong>every</strong> team at Gatsby. Seamlessly blending between the different and varied personas of engineering, executives, and product (to name a few!) is challenging, but rewarding. You’ll need to grow these relationships and build up your own subject matter expertise to meet and exceed the needs of each of these different groups.</p><p><br></p><p>In this role, your strong technical and written/verbal communication skills will be instrumental to our success as we grow the customer base at Gatsby and ensure our customers’ needs are not only being met, but blown away by the experience of using Gatsby’s products.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What you’ll do on a day-to-day basis</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Depending on the day, you’ll:</p><p><br></p><ul><li><strong>Ensure users wildly succeed on their journey with Gatsby</strong>.We have a growing and diverse mix of customers’ skill sets. You’ll directly work with these customers, and potential customers, to unblock them from using Gatsby, resolve issues, and categorize issues as open-source, Cloud, or user error and use this direct feedback to drive direct improvements in Gatsby.</li><li><strong>Drive monumental growth in our user base</strong>. Leveraging your mastery of communication, you’ll work directly with potential customers to make the benefits of Gatsby clear, obvious, and apparent. You’ll lead with kindness and empathy and guide customers on their transition into using Gatsby and our Cloud products through workshops, written communication, video calls, and more.</li><li><strong>Work with engineers shaping the direction of the web</strong>. You’ll work with some of the sharpest, multi-talented engineers on the planet. You’ll learn, help others learn, and thrive in an environment where we’re all working together towards this common goal of making Gatsby the way to build for the web.</li><li><strong>Deliver lightning-quick pull requests from customer feedback. </strong>As an engineer, you’ll need to first pinpoint the root cause of issues. Whenever possible, if these issues can be fixed quickly, fix them and eliminate a whole type of issue for our customers whether they’re code, documentation, or some combination of both!</li><li><strong>Shape the integration ecosystem</strong>. One of the most interesting ideas of Gatsby is “bring data from anywhere” (see: Journey to the Content Mesh) which has led to a proliferation of excellent source plugins from integrations like Wordpress, Drupal, Contentful, and many, many more. You’ll work directly with integrations to guide towards real, delivered customer value and enable a “pit of success” for our customers.</li><li><strong>Turn the reactive proactive.</strong> You’ll build and enable automations that identify issues and proactively alert customers of potential issues before a support request is even issued.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Experience you should have</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Expertise in the modern JavaScript ecosystem</strong>. Gatsby is built on the shoulders of giants, making use of technologies like Node.js, GraphQL, React, webpack, and Babel.</li><li><strong>Ability to dive into complex problems. You should be able to quickly assess, understand, and assess where and how bugs arise in customer code.&nbsp;</strong></li><li><strong>Strong written and verbal communication skills</strong>. You’ll clearly and concisely communicate via Google Docs, Github, Slack, and Zoom to name a few.</li><li><strong>Debugging code. Bugs should frustrate you. When you see a customer struggling with using Gatsby, that’s your bat signal to improve that experience and get to the crux of the issue and unblock the customer.</strong></li><li><strong>Ready and willing to ask and answer questions.</strong> You’re comfortable saying you’re unsure, asking for help, and reaching out to assist others. You thrive and Gatsby thrives because of continuous learning.</li><li><strong>You’ve had direct customer experience.</strong> You may have had a direct line of communication with customers, and with this direct line, drove improvements and helped customers succeed in using your product. You may have experience using a tool like Intercom, Zendesk, etc.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Experience it would be nice if you had, but isn’t required</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Public speaking experience.</strong> You may have given talks at a local meetup, or even at a conference in front of hundreds of people.</li><li><strong>Leading a team.</strong> You may have experience leading a team or projects. You’ve helped your team level-up and reach your levels of technical and communication expertise.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>The best parts of this job</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Measurably improve the experience of using Gatsby. </strong>You’ll have a direct pulse on the growing Gatsby Cloud customer base. You’ll leverage this direct connection to surface meaningful, rewarding improvements to the customer experience of using Gatsby.</li><li><strong>Live and breathe on the cutting edge. </strong>You’ll be at the cutting edge of website development — working on one of the fastest-growing site building frameworks on the market, digging into the Gatsby’s innovatively architected codebase and build system, using modern tools such as Node, React, and GraphQL.</li><li><strong>Flexibility to shape <em>your</em> role to be most impactful. </strong>At a startup, key traits are adaptability and flexibility. Shape the unknown and make it your known, maximizing your impact to Gatsby and helping shape what the Customer Success department means to Gatsby and how it can be maximally impactful.</li><li><strong>Hard problems? Oh yeah, we got ‘em. </strong>You’ll be solving incredibly difficult technical challenges every day. Put on your thinking cap and prepare yourself for hard, yet fun and rewarding technical challenges.</li><li><strong>Grow and learn from a vibrant, eager, and engaged community. </strong>You’ll be part of an active, open, friendly community of developers who are really excited about building high-performance, fun-to-use websites.</li><li><strong>Make Gatsby <em>the </em>way to build for the web. </strong>Your role will be key to making Gatsby the next way to build on the web -- and a technology that enables the next billion internet users.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>The worst parts of this job</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Wearing many hats is challenging. </strong>To be most impactful, you’ll need to be an expert in multiple areas of Gatsby’s codebase, both open source and commercial. There’s a large learning curve to both areas, and one of the most difficult parts of the job is growing the context and experience necessary to classify issues as Core, Cloud, user, or something in between!</li><li><strong>Long-running, in-progress work without a clear end. </strong>It can be challenging to have lots of in-progress work without having the immediate gratification of shipping. For instance, vendor integrations take quite a while to move from initial sync to published and delivered customer value. You will need to grow comfortability in managing lots of in-progress work alongside day-to-day responsibilities.</li><li><strong>Multiple stakeholders with different backgrounds. </strong>Working directly with different (non-engineering) teams, leadership, and engineering means you have to be a master of communication and understanding what makes different folks tick. You need to be a chameleon of communication, adapting at every step to ensure different groups are aligned and always have the info they need to succeed.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Benefits for you</strong></p><ul><li>Unlimited vacation policy, with a minimum of 15 days paid vacation time</li><li>Amazing health, dental, and vision insurance for you and your family <em>(US only)</em></li><li>3 months of paid parental leave covering both adoption and foster placement</li><li>Skip the commute with remote work</li><li>Fly to cool locations 3x/year for company-wide meetups&nbsp; (paused for now...)</li><li>Stock options in a fast-growing startup</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Our Hiring Process</strong></p><p>Gatsby is an equal opportunity employer. We eagerly seek applicants of diverse backgrounds and hire without regard to race, color, gender identity, religion, national origin, ancestry, citizenship, physical abilities (or disability), age, sexual orientation, veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by law. Cultivating inclusivity and diversity is a top priority.</p><p><br></p><p>Headhunters and recruitment agencies may not submit resumes/CVs through this website or directly to managers. Gatsby does not accept unsolicited headhunter and agency resumes, and will not pay fees to any third-party agency or company that does not have a signed agreement with Gatsby.</p></div><button class=\"show-more-less-html__button show-more-less-html__button--more\" data-tracking-control-name=\"public_jobs_show-more-html-btn\" aria-label=\"Show more\" aria-expanded=\"false\">Show more<icon class=\"show-more-less-html__button-icon\" data-delayed-url=\"https://static-exp1.licdn.com/sc/p/com.linkedin.jobs-guest-frontend%3Ajobs-guest-frontend-static-content%2B1.1.612/f/%2Fjobs-guest-frontend%2Fguest-ui-lib%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fsvg-for-lazyloading%2Ficon-chevron-down.svg\"></icon></button><button class=\"show-more-less-html__button show-more-less-html__button--less\" data-tracking-control-name=\"public_jobs_show-less-html-btn\" aria-label=\"Show less\" aria-expanded=\"true\">Show less<icon class=\"show-more-less-html__button-icon\" data-delayed-url=\"https://static-exp1.licdn.com/sc/p/com.linkedin.jobs-guest-frontend%3Ajobs-guest-frontend-static-content%2B1.1.612/f/%2Fjobs-guest-frontend%2Fguest-ui-lib%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fsvg-for-lazyloading%2Ficon-chevron-up.svg\"></icon></button></section>",

We get it. That's why we want all of our Gurus to feel a sense of belonging that comes from feeling supported in all areas of their lives. Everyone has family, friends and interests outside of their careers, so we offer perks and benefits to make work, work better for you.<br><ul> <li><strong>4 weeks PTO, plus 10 sick days, and holidays.</strong> Because even when your office is your living room, we all need time to unplug.</li> <li><strong>Remotely awesome.</strong> Get $500 to level up your home office, monthly snack boxes, free Headspace access, weekly lunch funds, and $50 monthly for internet.</li> <li><strong>Human connection. </strong>Get to know the Gurus with good times and get-togethers inspired by our values, virtual happy hours, lunchtime trivia, or a socially distanced drive-in movie.</li> <li><strong>Gender-neutral paid parental leave.</strong> Expanding your family?

We now employ gurus in 30 states of the USA as well as in Australia and the UK. For the time being that's as far as we can go. We won't bore you with the details, but setting up the extra operations we would need to employ people in new states or countries is a little bit more expensive than replicating your database in another AZ, if you know what we mean. So as much as we would love to have staff in as many countries as we have students, we are only opening this role to applicants in areas we currently have operations.<br><br>If you're not sure if your US state is included, please still apply! We will let you know if you are in a state that we currently don't have operations. If anything changes we will reach back out.<br><br><strong>What's the interview process like at ACG?<br><br></strong>Applying for a job can feel intimidating and like a full-time job of its own. You shouldn't have to burn through a week of sick time or all your best out-of-office excuses just to put feelers out for a new career opportunity. We want to be as transparent about the process as possible to help ease your mind. It's our goal to provide you a fair, efficient interviewing experience that respects you and your time — and to do it all with a sidecar of delight.<br><br>Once you submit an application, we'll review it. If you're a good fit, you'll have an initial chat with a recruiter over the phone. A phone interview with a manager typically follows. Depending on your role, you might then be asked to do a little homework (but nothing too time consuming). Then we'll schedule a Zoom call to meet other members of the team, answer any questions you have, and give you a feel for what it's really like to work at ACG. If you're on the fence, just give it a try.<br><br>Keep being awesome, Cloud Gurus.</div><button class=\"show-more-less-html__button show-more-less-html__button--more\" data-tracking-control-name=\"public_jobs_show-more-html-btn\" aria-label=\"Show more\" aria-expanded=\"false\">Show more<icon class=\"show-more-less-html__button-icon\" data-delayed-url=\"https://static-exp1.licdn.com/sc/p/com.linkedin.jobs-guest-frontend%3Ajobs-guest-frontend-static-content%2B1.1.612/f/%2Fjobs-guest-frontend%2Fguest-ui-lib%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fsvg-for-lazyloading%2Ficon-chevron-down.svg\"></icon></button><button class=\"show-more-less-html__button show-more-less-html__button--less\" data-tracking-control-name=\"public_jobs_show-less-html-btn\" aria-label=\"Show less\" aria-expanded=\"true\">Show less<icon class=\"show-more-less-html__button-icon\" data-delayed-url=\"https://static-exp1.licdn.com/sc/p/com.linkedin.jobs-guest-frontend%3Ajobs-guest-frontend-static-content%2B1.1.612/f/%2Fjobs-guest-frontend%2Fguest-ui-lib%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fsvg-for-lazyloading%2Ficon-chevron-up.svg\"></icon></button></section>",

We help more than 5,000 companies build lovable products and be happy doing it. Our company is self-funded and profitable, and has been entirely remote since we started in 2013.<br><br><strong>Our team<br></strong>Aha! engineering is a mid-sized, fully remote team that is highly productive. We are centered around North American time zones so we can collaborate during the workday.<br><ul><li><strong>We move quickly</strong>: We ship code multiple times a day. We believe in getting new features in front of customers and iteratively improving as we learn what works and what does not.</li><li><strong>We collaborate</strong>: We each bring unique experiences and skills to the table. Working together to share that knowledge benefits the entire team and helps us produce the best results for our customers.</li><li><strong>We value product over process</strong>: We want the team to have the time and focus to solve complex challenges. We aim to minimize the overhead introduced by heavyweight processes and excessive meetings.</li><li><strong>We are happy</strong>: it is important to us that you love your job and are happy at work. Learn more about our company <u>values</u> . Check out our generous <u>benefits</u> .</li><li><strong>We enjoy</strong>: We like what we do. And we want you to love your job too. Learn more about The Responsive Method , our company values , and the generous benefits we offer. <br><br></li></ul><strong>Our technology<br></strong>Our sole product is the Aha! web application. It is a single-instance, multi-tenant Ruby on Rails monolith supported by Postgres (database), Redis (background jobs), and memcached (Rails caching). We also run a Node.js webserver to support collaborative editing and real-time updates. Our application is hosted on Amazon Web Services and architected with ECS for reproducibility and scalability.<br><br>We utilize a growing amount of React on the front end to build rich client-side experiences, including our fully collaborative text editor and our slide presentation editor. We balance the strengths of both technologies — Rails for its conventions and simplicity and React for more powerful interactive functionality.<br><br>We embrace new technologies that help us deliver a lovable product, but we also remain cognizant of the maintenance overhead that a new library or platform brings. We solve the problems in front of us rather than prematurely optimizing to address issues that may never materialize.<br><br>We do most of our collaboration and planning in Aha! itself, which we find especially rewarding. We also utilize GitHub, Slack, and GoToMeeting for video calls.<br><br><strong><u>Your Experience<br><br></u></strong>We believe that being a kind person who elevates the rest of the team is just as valuable as writing great code. You have strong problem-solving skills and experience working on important functionality for a cloud-based product. You are humble, eager to learn, and always willing to help others learn as well. You want to work with people who enjoy picking up a problem and solving it, regardless of the technologies and techniques involved.<br><br>Most of our features involve writing significant Ruby on Rails code, so you have meaningful past experience working in a Rails codebase. We also write a lot of React, but we are happy to help you learn that part on the job.<br><br><strong>Your work at Aha!<br></strong>We work on a broad range of features across the full stack. Your work will include:<br><ul><li>Implementing new features for our users, touching each layer of the MVC as needed</li><li>Building deeply interactive reporting interfaces using React</li><li>Working proactively with product and UX to refine and iterate on specifications as the feature takes shape</li><li>Investigating slow performance and optimizing queries to ensure Aha! is snappy and satisfying to use</li><li>Interfacing directly with users to quickly squash bugs as part of our regular customer support rotation </li><li>Documenting components in our style guide to help drive consistency<br><br></li></ul>If this sounds appealing, we would love to hear from you.

You want to work with people who enjoy picking up a problem and solving it, regardless of the technologies and techniques involved.<br><br>Most of our features involve writing significant Ruby on Rails code, so you have meaningful past experience working in a Rails codebase. We also write a lot of React, but we are happy to help you learn that part on the job.<br><br><strong>Your work at Aha!<br></strong>We work on a broad range of features across the full stack.

You want to work with people who enjoy picking up a problem and solving it, regardless of the technologies and techniques involved.<br><br>Most of our features involve writing significant Ruby on Rails code, so you have meaningful past experience working in a Rails codebase. We also write a lot of React, but we are happy to help you learn that part on the job.<br><br><strong>Your work at Aha!<br></strong>We work on a broad range of features across the full stack. Your work will include:<br><ul><li>Implementing new features for our users, touching each layer of the MVC as needed</li><li>Building deeply interactive reporting interfaces using React</li><li>Working proactively with product and UX to refine and iterate on specifications as the feature takes shape</li><li>Investigating slow performance and optimizing queries to ensure Aha! is snappy and satisfying to use</li><li>Interfacing directly with users to quickly squash bugs as part of our regular customer support rotation </li><li>Documenting components in our style guide to help drive consistency<br><br></li></ul>If this sounds appealing, we would love to hear from you.

You understand that there is more to software engineering than just getting it to work -- that keeping it working continuously while extending new functionality is a greater challenge. You believe good software development is not just a technical exercise. Great software teams are composed of people collaborating directly with clients and each other to find the best solution.<br><br></p><p> <br><br></p><p>This is something you strive for and seek to facilitate in the teams you have joined. You want to share your experience, judgment, and wisdom with up-and-coming developers. You care about clear communication with the business and your team to make sure you are building the right thing in a reasonable time frame. You are interested in full-stack development. You want to have an impact on the entire application stack. You follow the activities and opinions of other developers through books, blogs, podcasts, local communities, and social media. You want to work with people that you can learn from, and to learn from other colleagues.<br><br></p><p> <br><br></p><p>You may have one or more side-projects in various stages of completion. You enjoy the challenge of migrating a codebase from its current state toward something better over time Maintenance We support the software we have written to run our organization, but are committed to encompassing new technologies to extend and scale our existing portfolio to meet increasing demands. We document issues and provide analysis for future actionable improvements. The challenge we face is to add or change features in an existing architecture that makes measurable improvements without breaking existing functionality. To accomplish this, we rely heavily on automated testing and deployment.<br><br></p><p> <br><br></p><p><strong>TDD</strong> We are committed to test-driven development as an integral part of our development process. <strong>Continuous integration</strong> we believe that \"it works on my machine\" is not good enough. Many software problems for organizations are deployment related. We minimize these issues by being sure to build and test our software using automation to continuously improve our processes. <strong>Software Craftsmanship</strong> We are committed to being a learning and teaching organization. We have an internship program in which we teach college students how to be professional developers. We share knowledge and ideas through pairing, weekly developer meetings, and one-on-one conversations. Your manager is your mentor and will spend one-on-one time with you every week talking about your career and your aspirations. <strong>Mentorship</strong> We are committed to improving the development team we have through the sharing of knowledge and ideas.<br><br></p><p> <br><br></p><p>As a Senior Engineer, you are an example to your peers on how to do things. You model the behavior and attitudes you wish your peers to emulate. As a leader, you will ensure that your team is clear about what they're building and why. You communicate best practices, ensure clear communication, and foster a collaborative and inclusive culture. Leadership and Vision: As a senior engineer, you should have experience leading teams and projects. You will be the point person on a team, learning and understanding the business requirements. You will often be responsible for the design of solutions to problems. With this comes the requirement to effectively communicate your decisions, designs, and work with your team, the business, and everyone involved in the project.<br><br></p><p> <br><br></p><p><strong>The role:<br><br></strong></p><ul><li>Our average team consists of two developers, 1 QA representative, and business contact.</li><li>The business is in control of feature prioritization and scheduling.</li><li>The technical team estimates work and decide how the features will be implemented.</li><li>The whole team signs off on the software before it is released using our automated processes.</li><li>You'll pair with developers and testers to write unit and integration tests and to implement features. You'll have your changes tested in a production-like environment with a complete set of services, databases, and applications. In addition, you'll be guiding the design of the software you work on and showcasing professional development practices to others in the group along the way.</li><li>You will be looked at as a leader in the group.</li><li>We try to always do the correct thing, however, we're aware that there is room for improvement - things change, technologies evolve.</li><li>You'll spot opportunities for improvement and efficiency gains, evangelize your solutions to the team, and see them implemented.</li><li>Your professional growth is important to us.</li><li>To that end, we foster an open and collaborative culture in our development community and with our business teams.</li><li>Provide flex-time for engineers to participate in or present at conferences, meet-ups, seminars, etc. Create mentor and mentee relationships and opportunities</li><li>Send every developer to the conference of their choice each year Provide developers with a Pluralsight subscription</li></ul><p> <br><br></p><p><strong>Technologies we use:<br><br></strong></p><p>We use a mostly Microsoft .Net stack - SQL Server, C#, WPF, Winforms, IIS hosting, Signal-R with RabbitMQ as our transport for distributed processing, along with Github, Teamcity, and Octopus to build and deploy.<br><br></p><p> <br><br></p><p><strong>Technologies we ARE TRANSITIONING TO We are migrating to the AWS cloud platform</strong>:<br><br></p><p>This includes existing software for portfolio performance, client reporting, market data, and portfolio accounting, as well as software to implement new products and help scale and extend market reach in our existing products.

Here, you'll have the freedom to follow your curiosity. We're not afraid to just try, because when you're working with cutting edge technologies, experimentation and trying out new ideas have to be encouraged and celebrated. Our engineers are building the world's largest (and most awesome) cloud learning platform. Why? Our mission is <strong>to teach the world to cloud. </strong>Our fun, practical courses have helped over 1.5 million people learn to cloud, and we're just getting started.<br><br>We're not a training company that just decided to sell training courses. We grew up out of the cloud ecosystem. We were a bunch of cloud engineers who pulled people together to create a training platform. That's why we're genuinely passionate about what we create. And we are known for practicing what we preach.<br><br><strong><u>What Makes The Product &amp; Technology Team Awesome...<br><br></u></strong>Learning to cloud means unlocking a world of possibilities for our students.

The ones who have the humility and hunger to learn. - Sam Kroonenburg, Co-Founder and CEO<br><br></em><strong>More than a job<br><br></strong>Where you work isn't just a career decision -- it's a life decision. We get it. That's why we want all of our Gurus to feel a sense of belonging that comes from feeling supported in all areas of their lives. Everyone has family, friends and interests outside of their careers, so we offer perks and benefits to make work, work better for you.<br><ul> <li><strong>4 weeks PTO, plus 10 sick days, and holidays.</strong> Because even when your office is your living room, we all need time to unplug.</li> <li><strong>Remotely awesome.</strong> Get $500 to level up your home office, monthly snack boxes, free Headspace access, weekly lunch funds, and $50 monthly for internet.</li> <li><strong>Human connection. </strong>Get to know the Gurus with good times and get-togethers inspired by our values, virtual happy hours, lunchtime trivia, or a socially distanced drive-in movie.</li> <li><strong>Gender-neutral paid parental leave.</strong> Expanding your family?

We now employ gurus in 30 states of the USA as well as in Australia and the UK. For the time being that's as far as we can go. We won't bore you with the details, but setting up the extra operations we would need to employ people in new states or countries is a little bit more expensive than replicating your database in another AZ, if you know what we mean. So as much as we would love to have staff in as many countries as we have students, we are only opening this role to applicants in areas we currently have operations.<br><br>If you're not sure if your US state is included, please still apply! We will let you know if you are in a state that we currently don't have operations. If anything changes we will reach back out.<br><br><strong>What's the interview process like at ACG?<br><br></strong>Applying for a job can feel intimidating and like a full-time job of its own. You shouldn't have to burn through a week of sick time or all your best out-of-office excuses just to put feelers out for a new career opportunity. We want to be as transparent about the process as possible to help ease your mind. It's our goal to provide you a fair, efficient interviewing experience that respects you and your time — and to do it all with a sidecar of delight.<br><br>Once you submit an application, we'll review it. If you're a good fit, you'll have an initial chat with a recruiter over the phone. A phone interview with a manager typically follows. Depending on your role, you might then be asked to do a little homework (but nothing too time consuming). Then we'll schedule a Zoom call to meet other members of the team, answer any questions you have, and give you a feel for what it's really like to work at ACG. If you're on the fence, just give it a try.<br><br>Keep being awesome, Cloud Gurus.</div><button class=\"show-more-less-html__button show-more-less-html__button--more\" data-tracking-control-name=\"public_jobs_show-more-html-btn\" aria-label=\"Show more\" aria-expanded=\"false\">Show more<icon class=\"show-more-less-html__button-icon\" data-delayed-url=\"https://static-exp1.licdn.com/sc/p/com.linkedin.jobs-guest-frontend%3Ajobs-guest-frontend-static-content%2B1.1.612/f/%2Fjobs-guest-frontend%2Fguest-ui-lib%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fsvg-for-lazyloading%2Ficon-chevron-down.svg\"></icon></button><button class=\"show-more-less-html__button show-more-less-html__button--less\" data-tracking-control-name=\"public_jobs_show-less-html-btn\" aria-label=\"Show less\" aria-expanded=\"true\">Show less<icon class=\"show-more-less-html__button-icon\" data-delayed-url=\"https://static-exp1.licdn.com/sc/p/com.linkedin.jobs-guest-frontend%3Ajobs-guest-frontend-static-content%2B1.1.612/f/%2Fjobs-guest-frontend%2Fguest-ui-lib%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fsvg-for-lazyloading%2Ficon-chevron-up.svg\"></icon></button></section>",

Our application is hosted on Amazon Web Services and architected with ECS for reproducibility and scalability.<br><br>We utilize a growing amount of React on the front end to build rich client-side experiences, including our fully collaborative text editor and our slide presentation editor.

You have strong problem-solving skills and experience working on important functionality for a cloud-based product. You are humble, eager to learn, and always willing to help others learn as well. You want to work with people who enjoy picking up a problem and solving it, regardless of the technologies and techniques involved.<br><br>Most of our features involve writing significant Ruby on Rails code, so you have meaningful past experience working in a Rails codebase. We also write a lot of React, but we are happy to help you learn that part on the job.<br><br><strong>Your work at Aha!<br></strong>We work on a broad range of features across the full stack.

We balance the strengths of both technologies — Rails for its conventions and simplicity and React for more powerful interactive functionality.<br><br>We embrace new technologies that help us deliver a lovable product, but we also remain cognizant of the maintenance overhead that a new library or platform brings. We solve the problems in front of us rather than prematurely optimizing to address issues that may never materialize.<br><br>We do most of our collaboration and planning in Aha! itself, which we find especially rewarding. We also utilize GitHub, Slack, and GoToMeeting for video calls.<br><br><strong><u>Your Experience<br><br></u></strong>We believe that being a kind person who elevates the rest of the team is just as valuable as writing great code. You have strong problem-solving skills and experience working on important functionality for a cloud-based product. You are humble, eager to learn, and always willing to help others learn as well. You want to work with people who enjoy picking up a problem and solving it, regardless of the technologies and techniques involved.<br><br>Most of our features involve writing significant Ruby on Rails code, so you have meaningful past experience working in a Rails codebase. We also write a lot of React, but we are happy to help you learn that part on the job.<br><br><strong>Your work at Aha!<br></strong>We work on a broad range of features across the full stack. Your work will include:<br><ul><li>Implementing new features for our users, touching each layer of the MVC as needed</li><li>Building deeply interactive reporting interfaces using React</li><li>Working proactively with product and UX to refine and iterate on specifications as the feature takes shape</li><li>Investigating slow performance and optimizing queries to ensure Aha! is snappy and satisfying to use</li><li>Interfacing directly with users to quickly squash bugs as part of our regular customer support rotation </li><li>Documenting components in our style guide to help drive consistency<br><br></li></ul>If this sounds appealing, we would love to hear from you.

We are centered around North American time zones so we can collaborate during the workday.<br><ul><li><strong>We move quickly</strong>: We ship code multiple times a day. We believe in getting new features in front of customers and iteratively improving as we learn what works and what does not.</li><li><strong>We collaborate</strong>: We each bring unique experiences and skills to the table. Working together to share that knowledge benefits the entire team and helps us produce the best results for our customers.</li><li><strong>We value product over process</strong>: We want the team to have the time and focus to solve complex challenges.

It is a single-instance, multi-tenant Ruby on Rails monolith supported by Postgres (database), Redis (background jobs), and memcached (Rails caching). We also run a Node.js webserver to support collaborative editing and real-time updates. Our application is hosted on Amazon Web Services and architected with ECS for reproducibility and scalability.<br><br>We utilize a growing amount of React on the front end to build rich client-side experiences, including our fully collaborative text editor and our slide presentation editor. We balance the strengths of both technologies — Rails for its conventions and simplicity and React for more powerful interactive functionality.<br><br>We embrace new technologies that help us deliver a lovable product, but we also remain cognizant of the maintenance overhead that a new library or platform brings. We solve the problems in front of us rather than prematurely optimizing to address issues that may never materialize.<br><br>We do most of our collaboration and planning in Aha! itself, which we find especially rewarding. We also utilize GitHub, Slack, and GoToMeeting for video calls.<br><br><strong><u>Your Experience<br><br></u></strong>We believe that being a kind person who elevates the rest of the team is just as valuable as writing great code.

We help more than 5,000 companies build lovable products and be happy doing it. Our company is self-funded and profitable, and has been entirely remote since we started in 2013.<br><br><strong>Our team<br></strong>Aha! engineering is a mid-sized, fully remote team that is highly productive. We are centered around North American time zones so we can collaborate during the workday.<br><ul><li><strong>We move quickly</strong>: We ship code multiple times a day. We believe in getting new features in front of customers and iteratively improving as we learn what works and what does not.</li><li><strong>We collaborate</strong>: We each bring unique experiences and skills to the table. Working together to share that knowledge benefits the entire team and helps us produce the best results for our customers.</li><li><strong>We value product over process</strong>: We want the team to have the time and focus to solve complex challenges. We aim to minimize the overhead introduced by heavyweight processes and excessive meetings.</li><li><strong>We are happy</strong>: it is important to us that you love your job and are happy at work. Learn more about our company <u>values</u> . Check out our generous <u>benefits</u> .</li><li><strong>We enjoy</strong>: We like what we do. And we want you to love your job too. Learn more about The Responsive Method , our company values , and the generous benefits we offer. <br><br></li></ul><strong>Our technology<br></strong>Our sole product is the Aha! web application. It is a single-instance, multi-tenant Ruby on Rails monolith supported by Postgres (database), Redis (background jobs), and memcached (Rails caching). We also run a Node.js webserver to support collaborative editing and real-time updates. Our application is hosted on Amazon Web Services and architected with ECS for reproducibility and scalability.<br><br>We utilize a growing amount of React on the front end to build rich client-side experiences, including our fully collaborative text editor and our slide presentation editor. We balance the strengths of both technologies — Rails for its conventions and simplicity and React for more powerful interactive functionality.<br><br>We embrace new technologies that help us deliver a lovable product, but we also remain cognizant of the maintenance overhead that a new library or platform brings. We solve the problems in front of us rather than prematurely optimizing to address issues that may never materialize.<br><br>We do most of our collaboration and planning in Aha! itself, which we find especially rewarding. We also utilize GitHub, Slack, and GoToMeeting for video calls.<br><br><strong><u>Your Experience<br><br></u></strong>We believe that being a kind person who elevates the rest of the team is just as valuable as writing great code. You have strong problem-solving skills and experience working on important functionality for a cloud-based product. You are humble, eager to learn, and always willing to help others learn as well. You want to work with people who enjoy picking up a problem and solving it, regardless of the technologies and techniques involved.<br><br>Most of our features involve writing significant Ruby on Rails code, so you have meaningful past experience working in a Rails codebase. We also write a lot of React, but we are happy to help you learn that part on the job.<br><br><strong>Your work at Aha!<br></strong>We work on a broad range of features across the full stack. Your work will include:<br><ul><li>Implementing new features for our users, touching each layer of the MVC as needed</li><li>Building deeply interactive reporting interfaces using React</li><li>Working proactively with product and UX to refine and iterate on specifications as the feature takes shape</li><li>Investigating slow performance and optimizing queries to ensure Aha! is snappy and satisfying to use</li><li>Interfacing directly with users to quickly squash bugs as part of our regular customer support rotation </li><li>Documenting components in our style guide to help drive consistency<br><br></li></ul>If this sounds appealing, we would love to hear from you.

We help more than 5,000 companies build lovable products and be happy doing it. Our company is self-funded and profitable, and has been entirely remote since we started in 2013.<br><br><strong>Our team<br></strong>Aha! engineering is a mid-sized, fully remote team that is highly productive. We are centered around North American time zones so we can collaborate during the workday.<br><ul><li><strong>We move quickly</strong>: We ship code multiple times a day. We believe in getting new features in front of customers and iteratively improving as we learn what works and what does not.</li><li><strong>We collaborate</strong>: We each bring unique experiences and skills to the table. Working together to share that knowledge benefits the entire team and helps us produce the best results for our customers.</li><li><strong>We value product over process</strong>: We want the team to have the time and focus to solve complex challenges. We aim to minimize the overhead introduced by heavyweight processes and excessive meetings.</li><li><strong>We are happy</strong>: it is important to us that you love your job and are happy at work. Learn more about our company <u>values</u> . Check out our generous <u>benefits</u> .</li><li><strong>We enjoy</strong>: We like what we do. And we want you to love your job too. Learn more about The Responsive Method , our company values , and the generous benefits we offer. <br><br></li></ul><strong>Our technology<br></strong>Our sole product is the Aha! web application. It is a single-instance, multi-tenant Ruby on Rails monolith supported by Postgres (database), Redis (background jobs), and memcached (Rails caching). We also run a Node.js webserver to support collaborative editing and real-time updates. Our application is hosted on Amazon Web Services and architected with ECS for reproducibility and scalability.<br><br>We utilize a growing amount of React on the front end to build rich client-side experiences, including our fully collaborative text editor and our slide presentation editor. We balance the strengths of both technologies — Rails for its conventions and simplicity and React for more powerful interactive functionality.<br><br>We embrace new technologies that help us deliver a lovable product, but we also remain cognizant of the maintenance overhead that a new library or platform brings. We solve the problems in front of us rather than prematurely optimizing to address issues that may never materialize.<br><br>We do most of our collaboration and planning in Aha! itself, which we find especially rewarding. We also utilize GitHub, Slack, and GoToMeeting for video calls.<br><br><strong><u>Your Experience<br><br></u></strong>We believe that being a kind person who elevates the rest of the team is just as valuable as writing great code. You have strong problem-solving skills and experience working on important functionality for a cloud-based product. You are humble, eager to learn, and always willing to help others learn as well. You want to work with people who enjoy picking up a problem and solving it, regardless of the technologies and techniques involved.<br><br>Most of our features involve writing significant Ruby on Rails code, so you have meaningful past experience working in a Rails codebase. We also write a lot of React, but we are happy to help you learn that part on the job.<br><br><strong>Your work at Aha!<br></strong>We work on a broad range of features across the full stack. Your work will include:<br><ul><li>Implementing new features for our users, touching each layer of the MVC as needed</li><li>Building deeply interactive reporting interfaces using React</li><li>Working proactively with product and UX to refine and iterate on specifications as the feature takes shape</li><li>Investigating slow performance and optimizing queries to ensure Aha! is snappy and satisfying to use</li><li>Interfacing directly with users to quickly squash bugs as part of our regular customer support rotation </li><li>Documenting components in our style guide to help drive consistency<br><br></li></ul>If this sounds appealing, we would love to hear from you.

Our company is self-funded and profitable, and has been entirely remote since we started in 2013.<br><br><strong>Our team<br></strong>Aha! engineering is a mid-sized, fully remote team that is highly productive. We are centered around North American time zones so we can collaborate during the workday.<br><ul><li><strong>We move quickly</strong>: We ship code multiple times a day. We believe in getting new features in front of customers and iteratively improving as we learn what works and what does not.</li><li><strong>We collaborate</strong>: We each bring unique experiences and skills to the table. Working together to share that knowledge benefits the entire team and helps us produce the best results for our customers.</li><li><strong>We value product over process</strong>: We want the team to have the time and focus to solve complex challenges.

It is a single-instance, multi-tenant Ruby on Rails monolith supported by Postgres (database), Redis (background jobs), and memcached (Rails caching). We also run a Node.js webserver to support collaborative editing and real-time updates. Our application is hosted on Amazon Web Services and architected with ECS for reproducibility and scalability.<br><br>We utilize a growing amount of React on the front end to build rich client-side experiences, including our fully collaborative text editor and our slide presentation editor. We balance the strengths of both technologies — Rails for its conventions and simplicity and React for more powerful interactive functionality.<br><br>We embrace new technologies that help us deliver a lovable product, but we also remain cognizant of the maintenance overhead that a new library or platform brings. We solve the problems in front of us rather than prematurely optimizing to address issues that may never materialize.<br><br>We do most of our collaboration and planning in Aha! itself, which we find especially rewarding. We also utilize GitHub, Slack, and GoToMeeting for video calls.<br><br><strong><u>Your Experience<br><br></u></strong>We believe that being a kind person who elevates the rest of the team is just as valuable as writing great code. You have strong problem-solving skills and experience working on important functionality for a cloud-based product. You are humble, eager to learn, and always willing to help others learn as well. You want to work with people who enjoy picking up a problem and solving it, regardless of the technologies and techniques involved.<br><br>Most of our features involve writing significant Ruby on Rails code, so you have meaningful past experience working in a Rails codebase. We also write a lot of React, but we are happy to help you learn that part on the job.<br><br><strong>Your work at Aha!<br></strong>We work on a broad range of features across the full stack. Your work will include:<br><ul><li>Implementing new features for our users, touching each layer of the MVC as needed</li><li>Building deeply interactive reporting interfaces using React</li><li>Working proactively with product and UX to refine and iterate on specifications as the feature takes shape</li><li>Investigating slow performance and optimizing queries to ensure Aha! is snappy and satisfying to use</li><li>Interfacing directly with users to quickly squash bugs as part of our regular customer support rotation </li><li>Documenting components in our style guide to help drive consistency<br><br></li></ul>If this sounds appealing, we would love to hear from you.

We help more than 5,000 companies build lovable products and be happy doing it. Our company is self-funded and profitable, and has been entirely remote since we started in 2013.<br><br><strong>Our team<br></strong>Aha! engineering is a mid-sized, fully remote team that is highly productive. We are centered around North American time zones so we can collaborate during the workday.<br><ul><li><strong>We move quickly</strong>: We ship code multiple times a day. We believe in getting new features in front of customers and iteratively improving as we learn what works and what does not.</li><li><strong>We collaborate</strong>: We each bring unique experiences and skills to the table. Working together to share that knowledge benefits the entire team and helps us produce the best results for our customers.</li><li><strong>We value product over process</strong>: We want the team to have the time and focus to solve complex challenges. We aim to minimize the overhead introduced by heavyweight processes and excessive meetings.</li><li><strong>We are happy</strong>: it is important to us that you love your job and are happy at work. Learn more about our company <u>values</u> . Check out our generous <u>benefits</u> .</li><li><strong>We enjoy</strong>: We like what we do. And we want you to love your job too. Learn more about The Responsive Method , our company values , and the generous benefits we offer. <br><br></li></ul><strong>Our technology<br></strong>Our sole product is the Aha! web application. It is a single-instance, multi-tenant Ruby on Rails monolith supported by Postgres (database), Redis (background jobs), and memcached (Rails caching). We also run a Node.js webserver to support collaborative editing and real-time updates. Our application is hosted on Amazon Web Services and architected with ECS for reproducibility and scalability.<br><br>We utilize a growing amount of React on the front end to build rich client-side experiences, including our fully collaborative text editor and our slide presentation editor. We balance the strengths of both technologies — Rails for its conventions and simplicity and React for more powerful interactive functionality.<br><br>We embrace new technologies that help us deliver a lovable product, but we also remain cognizant of the maintenance overhead that a new library or platform brings. We solve the problems in front of us rather than prematurely optimizing to address issues that may never materialize.<br><br>We do most of our collaboration and planning in Aha! itself, which we find especially rewarding. We also utilize GitHub, Slack, and GoToMeeting for video calls.<br><br><strong><u>Your Experience<br><br></u></strong>We believe that being a kind person who elevates the rest of the team is just as valuable as writing great code. You have strong problem-solving skills and experience working on important functionality for a cloud-based product. You are humble, eager to learn, and always willing to help others learn as well. You want to work with people who enjoy picking up a problem and solving it, regardless of the technologies and techniques involved.<br><br>Most of our features involve writing significant Ruby on Rails code, so you have meaningful past experience working in a Rails codebase. We also write a lot of React, but we are happy to help you learn that part on the job.<br><br><strong>Your work at Aha!<br></strong>We work on a broad range of features across the full stack. Your work will include:<br><ul><li>Implementing new features for our users, touching each layer of the MVC as needed</li><li>Building deeply interactive reporting interfaces using React</li><li>Working proactively with product and UX to refine and iterate on specifications as the feature takes shape</li><li>Investigating slow performance and optimizing queries to ensure Aha! is snappy and satisfying to use</li><li>Interfacing directly with users to quickly squash bugs as part of our regular customer support rotation </li><li>Documenting components in our style guide to help drive consistency<br><br></li></ul>If this sounds appealing, we would love to hear from you.

Our company is self-funded and profitable, and has been entirely remote since we started in 2013.<br><br><strong>Our team<br></strong>Aha! engineering is a mid-sized, fully remote team that is highly productive. We are centered around North American time zones so we can collaborate during the workday.<br><ul><li><strong>We move quickly</strong>: We ship code multiple times a day. We believe in getting new features in front of customers and iteratively improving as we learn what works and what does not.</li><li><strong>We collaborate</strong>: We each bring unique experiences and skills to the table. Working together to share that knowledge benefits the entire team and helps us produce the best results for our customers.</li><li><strong>We value product over process</strong>: We want the team to have the time and focus to solve complex challenges. We aim to minimize the overhead introduced by heavyweight processes and excessive meetings.</li><li><strong>We are happy</strong>: it is important to us that you love your job and are happy at work.

It is a single-instance, multi-tenant Ruby on Rails monolith supported by Postgres (database), Redis (background jobs), and memcached (Rails caching). We also run a Node.js webserver to support collaborative editing and real-time updates. Our application is hosted on Amazon Web Services and architected with ECS for reproducibility and scalability.<br><br>We utilize a growing amount of React on the front end to build rich client-side experiences, including our fully collaborative text editor and our slide presentation editor. We balance the strengths of both technologies — Rails for its conventions and simplicity and React for more powerful interactive functionality.<br><br>We embrace new technologies that help us deliver a lovable product, but we also remain cognizant of the maintenance overhead that a new library or platform brings. We solve the problems in front of us rather than prematurely optimizing to address issues that may never materialize.<br><br>We do most of our collaboration and planning in Aha! itself, which we find especially rewarding. We also utilize GitHub, Slack, and GoToMeeting for video calls.<br><br><strong><u>Your Experience<br><br></u></strong>We believe that being a kind person who elevates the rest of the team is just as valuable as writing great code. You have strong problem-solving skills and experience working on important functionality for a cloud-based product. You are humble, eager to learn, and always willing to help others learn as well. You want to work with people who enjoy picking up a problem and solving it, regardless of the technologies and techniques involved.<br><br>Most of our features involve writing significant Ruby on Rails code, so you have meaningful past experience working in a Rails codebase. We also write a lot of React, but we are happy to help you learn that part on the job.<br><br><strong>Your work at Aha!<br></strong>We work on a broad range of features across the full stack. Your work will include:<br><ul><li>Implementing new features for our users, touching each layer of the MVC as needed</li><li>Building deeply interactive reporting interfaces using React</li><li>Working proactively with product and UX to refine and iterate on specifications as the feature takes shape</li><li>Investigating slow performance and optimizing queries to ensure Aha! is snappy and satisfying to use</li><li>Interfacing directly with users to quickly squash bugs as part of our regular customer support rotation </li><li>Documenting components in our style guide to help drive consistency<br><br></li></ul>If this sounds appealing, we would love to hear from you.

We are centered around North American time zones so we can collaborate during the workday.<br><ul><li><strong>We move quickly</strong>: We ship code multiple times a day.

Our application is hosted on Amazon Web Services and architected with ECS for reproducibility and scalability.<br><br>We utilize a growing amount of React on the front end to build rich client-side experiences, including our fully collaborative text editor and our slide presentation editor. We balance the strengths of both technologies — Rails for its conventions and simplicity and React for more powerful interactive functionality.<br><br>We embrace new technologies that help us deliver a lovable product, but we also remain cognizant of the maintenance overhead that a new library or platform brings. We solve the problems in front of us rather than prematurely optimizing to address issues that may never materialize.<br><br>We do most of our collaboration and planning in Aha! itself, which we find especially rewarding. We also utilize GitHub, Slack, and GoToMeeting for video calls.<br><br><strong><u>Your Experience<br><br></u></strong>We believe that being a kind person who elevates the rest of the team is just as valuable as writing great code. You have strong problem-solving skills and experience working on important functionality for a cloud-based product. You are humble, eager to learn, and always willing to help others learn as well. You want to work with people who enjoy picking up a problem and solving it, regardless of the technologies and techniques involved.<br><br>Most of our features involve writing significant Ruby on Rails code, so you have meaningful past experience working in a Rails codebase. We also write a lot of React, but we are happy to help you learn that part on the job.<br><br><strong>Your work at Aha!<br></strong>We work on a broad range of features across the full stack. Your work will include:<br><ul><li>Implementing new features for our users, touching each layer of the MVC as needed</li><li>Building deeply interactive reporting interfaces using React</li><li>Working proactively with product and UX to refine and iterate on specifications as the feature takes shape</li><li>Investigating slow performance and optimizing queries to ensure Aha! is snappy and satisfying to use</li><li>Interfacing directly with users to quickly squash bugs as part of our regular customer support rotation </li><li>Documenting components in our style guide to help drive consistency<br><br></li></ul>If this sounds appealing, we would love to hear from you.

Our company is self-funded and profitable, and has been entirely remote since we started in 2013.<br><br><strong>Our team<br></strong>Aha! engineering is a mid-sized, fully remote team that is highly productive. We are centered around North American time zones so we can collaborate during the workday.<br><ul><li><strong>We move quickly</strong>: We ship code multiple times a day. We believe in getting new features in front of customers and iteratively improving as we learn what works and what does not.</li><li><strong>We collaborate</strong>: We each bring unique experiences and skills to the table. Working together to share that knowledge benefits the entire team and helps us produce the best results for our customers.</li><li><strong>We value product over process</strong>: We want the team to have the time and focus to solve complex challenges.

It is a single-instance, multi-tenant Ruby on Rails monolith supported by Postgres (database), Redis (background jobs), and memcached (Rails caching). We also run a Node.js webserver to support collaborative editing and real-time updates. Our application is hosted on Amazon Web Services and architected with ECS for reproducibility and scalability.<br><br>We utilize a growing amount of React on the front end to build rich client-side experiences, including our fully collaborative text editor and our slide presentation editor. We balance the strengths of both technologies — Rails for its conventions and simplicity and React for more powerful interactive functionality.<br><br>We embrace new technologies that help us deliver a lovable product, but we also remain cognizant of the maintenance overhead that a new library or platform brings. We solve the problems in front of us rather than prematurely optimizing to address issues that may never materialize.<br><br>We do most of our collaboration and planning in Aha! itself, which we find especially rewarding. We also utilize GitHub, Slack, and GoToMeeting for video calls.<br><br><strong><u>Your Experience<br><br></u></strong>We believe that being a kind person who elevates the rest of the team is just as valuable as writing great code. You have strong problem-solving skills and experience working on important functionality for a cloud-based product. You are humble, eager to learn, and always willing to help others learn as well. You want to work with people who enjoy picking up a problem and solving it, regardless of the technologies and techniques involved.<br><br>Most of our features involve writing significant Ruby on Rails code, so you have meaningful past experience working in a Rails codebase. We also write a lot of React, but we are happy to help you learn that part on the job.<br><br><strong>Your work at Aha!<br></strong>We work on a broad range of features across the full stack. Your work will include:<br><ul><li>Implementing new features for our users, touching each layer of the MVC as needed</li><li>Building deeply interactive reporting interfaces using React</li><li>Working proactively with product and UX to refine and iterate on specifications as the feature takes shape</li><li>Investigating slow performance and optimizing queries to ensure Aha! is snappy and satisfying to use</li><li>Interfacing directly with users to quickly squash bugs as part of our regular customer support rotation </li><li>Documenting components in our style guide to help drive consistency<br><br></li></ul>If this sounds appealing, we would love to hear from you.

We help more than 5,000 companies build lovable products and be happy doing it. Our company is self-funded and profitable, and has been entirely remote since we started in 2013.<br><br><strong>Our team<br></strong>Aha! engineering is a mid-sized, fully remote team that is highly productive. We are centered around North American time zones so we can collaborate during the workday.<br><ul><li><strong>We move quickly</strong>: We ship code multiple times a day. We believe in getting new features in front of customers and iteratively improving as we learn what works and what does not.</li><li><strong>We collaborate</strong>: We each bring unique experiences and skills to the table. Working together to share that knowledge benefits the entire team and helps us produce the best results for our customers.</li><li><strong>We value product over process</strong>: We want the team to have the time and focus to solve complex challenges. We aim to minimize the overhead introduced by heavyweight processes and excessive meetings.</li><li><strong>We are happy</strong>: it is important to us that you love your job and are happy at work. Learn more about our company <u>values</u> . Check out our generous <u>benefits</u> .</li><li><strong>We enjoy</strong>: We like what we do. And we want you to love your job too. Learn more about The Responsive Method , our company values , and the generous benefits we offer. <br><br></li></ul><strong>Our technology<br></strong>Our sole product is the Aha! web application. It is a single-instance, multi-tenant Ruby on Rails monolith supported by Postgres (database), Redis (background jobs), and memcached (Rails caching). We also run a Node.js webserver to support collaborative editing and real-time updates. Our application is hosted on Amazon Web Services and architected with ECS for reproducibility and scalability.<br><br>We utilize a growing amount of React on the front end to build rich client-side experiences, including our fully collaborative text editor and our slide presentation editor. We balance the strengths of both technologies — Rails for its conventions and simplicity and React for more powerful interactive functionality.<br><br>We embrace new technologies that help us deliver a lovable product, but we also remain cognizant of the maintenance overhead that a new library or platform brings. We solve the problems in front of us rather than prematurely optimizing to address issues that may never materialize.<br><br>We do most of our collaboration and planning in Aha! itself, which we find especially rewarding. We also utilize GitHub, Slack, and GoToMeeting for video calls.<br><br><strong><u>Your Experience<br><br></u></strong>We believe that being a kind person who elevates the rest of the team is just as valuable as writing great code. You have strong problem-solving skills and experience working on important functionality for a cloud-based product. You are humble, eager to learn, and always willing to help others learn as well. You want to work with people who enjoy picking up a problem and solving it, regardless of the technologies and techniques involved.<br><br>Most of our features involve writing significant Ruby on Rails code, so you have meaningful past experience working in a Rails codebase. We also write a lot of React, but we are happy to help you learn that part on the job.<br><br><strong>Your work at Aha!<br></strong>We work on a broad range of features across the full stack. Your work will include:<br><ul><li>Implementing new features for our users, touching each layer of the MVC as needed</li><li>Building deeply interactive reporting interfaces using React</li><li>Working proactively with product and UX to refine and iterate on specifications as the feature takes shape</li><li>Investigating slow performance and optimizing queries to ensure Aha! is snappy and satisfying to use</li><li>Interfacing directly with users to quickly squash bugs as part of our regular customer support rotation </li><li>Documenting components in our style guide to help drive consistency<br><br></li></ul>If this sounds appealing, we would love to hear from you.

We help more than 5,000 companies build lovable products and be happy doing it. Our company is self-funded and profitable, and has been entirely remote since we started in 2013.<br><br><strong>Our team<br></strong>Aha! engineering is a mid-sized, fully remote team that is highly productive. We are centered around North American time zones so we can collaborate during the workday.<br><ul><li><strong>We move quickly</strong>: We ship code multiple times a day. We believe in getting new features in front of customers and iteratively improving as we learn what works and what does not.</li><li><strong>We collaborate</strong>: We each bring unique experiences and skills to the table. Working together to share that knowledge benefits the entire team and helps us produce the best results for our customers.</li><li><strong>We value product over process</strong>: We want the team to have the time and focus to solve complex challenges. We aim to minimize the overhead introduced by heavyweight processes and excessive meetings.</li><li><strong>We are happy</strong>: it is important to us that you love your job and are happy at work. Learn more about our company <u>values</u> . Check out our generous <u>benefits</u> .</li><li><strong>We enjoy</strong>: We like what we do. And we want you to love your job too. Learn more about The Responsive Method , our company values , and the generous benefits we offer. <br><br></li></ul><strong>Our technology<br></strong>Our sole product is the Aha! web application. It is a single-instance, multi-tenant Ruby on Rails monolith supported by Postgres (database), Redis (background jobs), and memcached (Rails caching). We also run a Node.js webserver to support collaborative editing and real-time updates. Our application is hosted on Amazon Web Services and architected with ECS for reproducibility and scalability.<br><br>We utilize a growing amount of React on the front end to build rich client-side experiences, including our fully collaborative text editor and our slide presentation editor. We balance the strengths of both technologies — Rails for its conventions and simplicity and React for more powerful interactive functionality.<br><br>We embrace new technologies that help us deliver a lovable product, but we also remain cognizant of the maintenance overhead that a new library or platform brings. We solve the problems in front of us rather than prematurely optimizing to address issues that may never materialize.<br><br>We do most of our collaboration and planning in Aha! itself, which we find especially rewarding. We also utilize GitHub, Slack, and GoToMeeting for video calls.<br><br><strong><u>Your Experience<br><br></u></strong>We believe that being a kind person who elevates the rest of the team is just as valuable as writing great code. You have strong problem-solving skills and experience working on important functionality for a cloud-based product. You are humble, eager to learn, and always willing to help others learn as well. You want to work with people who enjoy picking up a problem and solving it, regardless of the technologies and techniques involved.<br><br>Most of our features involve writing significant Ruby on Rails code, so you have meaningful past experience working in a Rails codebase. We also write a lot of React, but we are happy to help you learn that part on the job.<br><br><strong>Your work at Aha!<br></strong>We work on a broad range of features across the full stack. Your work will include:<br><ul><li>Implementing new features for our users, touching each layer of the MVC as needed</li><li>Building deeply interactive reporting interfaces using React</li><li>Working proactively with product and UX to refine and iterate on specifications as the feature takes shape</li><li>Investigating slow performance and optimizing queries to ensure Aha! is snappy and satisfying to use</li><li>Interfacing directly with users to quickly squash bugs as part of our regular customer support rotation </li><li>Documenting components in our style guide to help drive consistency<br><br></li></ul>If this sounds appealing, we would love to hear from you.

We help more than 5,000 companies build lovable products and be happy doing it. Our company is self-funded and profitable, and has been entirely remote since we started in 2013.<br><br><strong>Our team<br></strong>Aha! engineering is a mid-sized, fully remote team that is highly productive. We are centered around North American time zones so we can collaborate during the workday.<br><ul><li><strong>We move quickly</strong>: We ship code multiple times a day. We believe in getting new features in front of customers and iteratively improving as we learn what works and what does not.</li><li><strong>We collaborate</strong>: We each bring unique experiences and skills to the table. Working together to share that knowledge benefits the entire team and helps us produce the best results for our customers.</li><li><strong>We value product over process</strong>: We want the team to have the time and focus to solve complex challenges. We aim to minimize the overhead introduced by heavyweight processes and excessive meetings.</li><li><strong>We are happy</strong>: it is important to us that you love your job and are happy at work. Learn more about our company <u>values</u> . Check out our generous <u>benefits</u> .</li><li><strong>We enjoy</strong>: We like what we do. And we want you to love your job too. Learn more about The Responsive Method , our company values , and the generous benefits we offer. <br><br></li></ul><strong>Our technology<br></strong>Our sole product is the Aha! web application. It is a single-instance, multi-tenant Ruby on Rails monolith supported by Postgres (database), Redis (background jobs), and memcached (Rails caching). We also run a Node.js webserver to support collaborative editing and real-time updates. Our application is hosted on Amazon Web Services and architected with ECS for reproducibility and scalability.<br><br>We utilize a growing amount of React on the front end to build rich client-side experiences, including our fully collaborative text editor and our slide presentation editor. We balance the strengths of both technologies — Rails for its conventions and simplicity and React for more powerful interactive functionality.<br><br>We embrace new technologies that help us deliver a lovable product, but we also remain cognizant of the maintenance overhead that a new library or platform brings. We solve the problems in front of us rather than prematurely optimizing to address issues that may never materialize.<br><br>We do most of our collaboration and planning in Aha! itself, which we find especially rewarding. We also utilize GitHub, Slack, and GoToMeeting for video calls.<br><br><strong><u>Your Experience<br><br></u></strong>We believe that being a kind person who elevates the rest of the team is just as valuable as writing great code. You have strong problem-solving skills and experience working on important functionality for a cloud-based product. You are humble, eager to learn, and always willing to help others learn as well. You want to work with people who enjoy picking up a problem and solving it, regardless of the technologies and techniques involved.<br><br>Most of our features involve writing significant Ruby on Rails code, so you have meaningful past experience working in a Rails codebase. We also write a lot of React, but we are happy to help you learn that part on the job.<br><br><strong>Your work at Aha!<br></strong>We work on a broad range of features across the full stack. Your work will include:<br><ul><li>Implementing new features for our users, touching each layer of the MVC as needed</li><li>Building deeply interactive reporting interfaces using React</li><li>Working proactively with product and UX to refine and iterate on specifications as the feature takes shape</li><li>Investigating slow performance and optimizing queries to ensure Aha! is snappy and satisfying to use</li><li>Interfacing directly with users to quickly squash bugs as part of our regular customer support rotation </li><li>Documenting components in our style guide to help drive consistency<br><br></li></ul>If this sounds appealing, we would love to hear from you.

We help more than 5,000 companies build lovable products and be happy doing it. Our company is self-funded and profitable, and has been entirely remote since we started in 2013.<br><br><strong>Our team<br></strong>Aha! engineering is a mid-sized, fully remote team that is highly productive. We are centered around North American time zones so we can collaborate during the workday.<br><ul><li><strong>We move quickly</strong>: We ship code multiple times a day. We believe in getting new features in front of customers and iteratively improving as we learn what works and what does not.</li><li><strong>We collaborate</strong>: We each bring unique experiences and skills to the table. Working together to share that knowledge benefits the entire team and helps us produce the best results for our customers.</li><li><strong>We value product over process</strong>: We want the team to have the time and focus to solve complex challenges. We aim to minimize the overhead introduced by heavyweight processes and excessive meetings.</li><li><strong>We are happy</strong>: it is important to us that you love your job and are happy at work. Learn more about our company <u>values</u> . Check out our generous <u>benefits</u> .</li><li><strong>We enjoy</strong>: We like what we do. And we want you to love your job too. Learn more about The Responsive Method , our company values , and the generous benefits we offer. <br><br></li></ul><strong>Our technology<br></strong>Our sole product is the Aha! web application. It is a single-instance, multi-tenant Ruby on Rails monolith supported by Postgres (database), Redis (background jobs), and memcached (Rails caching). We also run a Node.js webserver to support collaborative editing and real-time updates. Our application is hosted on Amazon Web Services and architected with ECS for reproducibility and scalability.<br><br>We use React for rich client-side experiences on the front end. Some of the features we have built with React include:<br><ul><li>Our fully collaborative <u>text editor</u> : Supports multiple cursors and simultaneous editing by any number of users. We also published a <u>blog post</u> explaining the underlying technology.</li><li>Our <u>presentation editor</u> : Allows users to create presentations with slide themes, shapes, text, and embedded Aha! reports (which update live so the presentation is always current).</li><li>Our <u>Gantt chart</u> : Supports scaling and scrolling to change the timeline, drag-and-drop, and quick actions to create records or sort the bars.<br><br></li></ul>We embrace new technologies that help us deliver a lovable product, but we also remain cognizant of the maintenance overhead that a new library or platform brings. We solve the problems in front of us, rather than prematurely optimizing to address issues that may never materialize.<br><br>We do most of our collaboration and planning in Aha! itself, which we find especially rewarding. We also utilize GitHub, Slack, and GoToMeeting for video calls.<br><br><strong><u>Your Experience<br><br></u></strong>We believe that being a kind person who elevates the rest of the team is just as valuable as writing great code. You have strong problem-solving skills and experience working on important functionality for a cloud-based product. You are humble, eager to learn, and always willing to help others learn as well. You want to work with people who enjoy picking up a problem and solving it, regardless of the technologies and techniques involved.<br><br>All of our engineers work across the full stack. As a Senior Front End Engineer, you can expect to spend the majority of your time working with React or HTML/CSS, but you will also be asked to write significant back end code in Ruby on Rails to support the front end features you are building.<br><br><strong>Your work at Aha!<br></strong>We work on a broad range of features across the full stack. Your work will include:<br><ul><li>Implementing new features for our users, touching each layer of the MVC as needed</li><li>Building deeply interactive reporting interfaces using React</li><li>Working proactively with product and UX to refine and iterate on specifications as the feature takes shape</li><li>Optimizing browser performance on screens and components that render large quantities of data to ensure Aha! is snappy and satisfying to use</li><li>Interfacing directly with users to quickly squash bugs as part of our regular customer support rotation </li><li>Documenting components in our style guide to help drive consistency<br><br></li></ul>If this sounds appealing, we would love to hear from you.

It is a single-instance, multi-tenant Ruby on Rails monolith supported by Postgres (database), Redis (background jobs), and memcached (Rails caching). We also run a Node.js webserver to support collaborative editing and real-time updates. Our application is hosted on Amazon Web Services and architected with ECS for reproducibility and scalability.<br><br>We utilize a growing amount of React on the front end to build rich client-side experiences, including our fully collaborative text editor and our slide presentation editor. We balance the strengths of both technologies — Rails for its conventions and simplicity and React for more powerful interactive functionality.<br><br>We embrace new technologies that help us deliver a lovable product, but we also remain cognizant of the maintenance overhead that a new library or platform brings. We solve the problems in front of us rather than prematurely optimizing to address issues that may never materialize.<br><br>We do most of our collaboration and planning in Aha! itself, which we find especially rewarding. We also utilize GitHub, Slack, and GoToMeeting for video calls.<br><br><strong><u>Your Experience<br><br></u></strong>We believe that being a kind person who elevates the rest of the team is just as valuable as writing great code. You have strong problem-solving skills and experience working on important functionality for a cloud-based product. You are humble, eager to learn, and always willing to help others learn as well. You want to work with people who enjoy picking up a problem and solving it, regardless of the technologies and techniques involved.<br><br>Most of our features involve writing significant Ruby on Rails code, so you have meaningful past experience working in a Rails codebase. We also write a lot of React, but we are happy to help you learn that part on the job.<br><br><strong>Your work at Aha!<br></strong>We work on a broad range of features across the full stack. Your work will include:<br><ul><li>Implementing new features for our users, touching each layer of the MVC as needed</li><li>Building deeply interactive reporting interfaces using React</li><li>Working proactively with product and UX to refine and iterate on specifications as the feature takes shape</li><li>Investigating slow performance and optimizing queries to ensure Aha! is snappy and satisfying to use</li><li>Interfacing directly with users to quickly squash bugs as part of our regular customer support rotation </li><li>Documenting components in our style guide to help drive consistency<br><br></li></ul>If this sounds appealing, we would love to hear from you.

We also run a Node.js webserver to support collaborative editing and real-time updates. Our application is hosted on Amazon Web Services and architected with ECS for reproducibility and scalability.<br><br>We utilize a growing amount of React on the front end to build rich client-side experiences, including our fully collaborative text editor and our slide presentation editor. We balance the strengths of both technologies — Rails for its conventions and simplicity and React for more powerful interactive functionality.<br><br>We embrace new technologies that help us deliver a lovable product, but we also remain cognizant of the maintenance overhead that a new library or platform brings. We solve the problems in front of us rather than prematurely optimizing to address issues that may never materialize.<br><br>We do most of our collaboration and planning in Aha! itself, which we find especially rewarding. We also utilize GitHub, Slack, and GoToMeeting for video calls.<br><br><strong><u>Your Experience<br><br></u></strong>We believe that being a kind person who elevates the rest of the team is just as valuable as writing great code. You have strong problem-solving skills and experience working on important functionality for a cloud-based product. You are humble, eager to learn, and always willing to help others learn as well. You want to work with people who enjoy picking up a problem and solving it, regardless of the technologies and techniques involved.<br><br>Most of our features involve writing significant Ruby on Rails code, so you have meaningful past experience working in a Rails codebase. We also write a lot of React, but we are happy to help you learn that part on the job.<br><br><strong>Your work at Aha!<br></strong>We work on a broad range of features across the full stack. Your work will include:<br><ul><li>Implementing new features for our users, touching each layer of the MVC as needed</li><li>Building deeply interactive reporting interfaces using React</li><li>Working proactively with product and UX to refine and iterate on specifications as the feature takes shape</li><li>Investigating slow performance and optimizing queries to ensure Aha! is snappy and satisfying to use</li><li>Interfacing directly with users to quickly squash bugs as part of our regular customer support rotation </li><li>Documenting components in our style guide to help drive consistency<br><br></li></ul>If this sounds appealing, we would love to hear from you.

We help more than 5,000 companies build lovable products and be happy doing it. Our company is self-funded and profitable, and has been entirely remote since we started in 2013.<br><br><strong>Our team<br></strong>Aha! engineering is a mid-sized, fully remote team that is highly productive. We are centered around North American time zones so we can collaborate during the workday.<br><ul><li><strong>We move quickly</strong>: We ship code multiple times a day. We believe in getting new features in front of customers and iteratively improving as we learn what works and what does not.</li><li><strong>We collaborate</strong>: We each bring unique experiences and skills to the table. Working together to share that knowledge benefits the entire team and helps us produce the best results for our customers.</li><li><strong>We value product over process</strong>: We want the team to have the time and focus to solve complex challenges. We aim to minimize the overhead introduced by heavyweight processes and excessive meetings.</li><li><strong>We are happy</strong>: it is important to us that you love your job and are happy at work. Learn more about our company <u>values</u> . Check out our generous <u>benefits</u> .</li><li><strong>We enjoy</strong>: We like what we do. And we want you to love your job too. Learn more about The Responsive Method , our company values , and the generous benefits we offer. <br><br></li></ul><strong>Our technology<br></strong>Our sole product is the Aha! web application. It is a single-instance, multi-tenant Ruby on Rails monolith supported by Postgres (database), Redis (background jobs), and memcached (Rails caching). We also run a Node.js webserver to support collaborative editing and real-time updates. Our application is hosted on Amazon Web Services and architected with ECS for reproducibility and scalability.<br><br>We utilize a growing amount of React on the front end to build rich client-side experiences, including our fully collaborative text editor and our slide presentation editor. We balance the strengths of both technologies — Rails for its conventions and simplicity and React for more powerful interactive functionality.<br><br>We embrace new technologies that help us deliver a lovable product, but we also remain cognizant of the maintenance overhead that a new library or platform brings. We solve the problems in front of us rather than prematurely optimizing to address issues that may never materialize.<br><br>We do most of our collaboration and planning in Aha! itself, which we find especially rewarding. We also utilize GitHub, Slack, and GoToMeeting for video calls.<br><br><strong><u>Your Experience<br><br></u></strong>We believe that being a kind person who elevates the rest of the team is just as valuable as writing great code. You have strong problem-solving skills and experience working on important functionality for a cloud-based product. You are humble, eager to learn, and always willing to help others learn as well. You want to work with people who enjoy picking up a problem and solving it, regardless of the technologies and techniques involved.<br><br>Most of our features involve writing significant Ruby on Rails code, so you have meaningful past experience working in a Rails codebase. We also write a lot of React, but we are happy to help you learn that part on the job.<br><br><strong>Your work at Aha!<br></strong>We work on a broad range of features across the full stack. Your work will include:<br><ul><li>Implementing new features for our users, touching each layer of the MVC as needed</li><li>Building deeply interactive reporting interfaces using React</li><li>Working proactively with product and UX to refine and iterate on specifications as the feature takes shape</li><li>Investigating slow performance and optimizing queries to ensure Aha! is snappy and satisfying to use</li><li>Interfacing directly with users to quickly squash bugs as part of our regular customer support rotation </li><li>Documenting components in our style guide to help drive consistency<br><br></li></ul>If this sounds appealing, we would love to hear from you.

We help more than 5,000 companies build lovable products and be happy doing it. Our company is self-funded and profitable, and has been entirely remote since we started in 2013.<br><br><strong>Our team<br></strong>Aha! engineering is a mid-sized, fully remote team that is highly productive. We are centered around North American time zones so we can collaborate during the workday.<br><ul><li><strong>We move quickly</strong>: We ship code multiple times a day. We believe in getting new features in front of customers and iteratively improving as we learn what works and what does not.</li><li><strong>We collaborate</strong>: We each bring unique experiences and skills to the table. Working together to share that knowledge benefits the entire team and helps us produce the best results for our customers.</li><li><strong>We value product over process</strong>: We want the team to have the time and focus to solve complex challenges. We aim to minimize the overhead introduced by heavyweight processes and excessive meetings.</li><li><strong>We are happy</strong>: it is important to us that you love your job and are happy at work. Learn more about our company <u>values</u> . Check out our generous <u>benefits</u> .</li><li><strong>We enjoy</strong>: We like what we do. And we want you to love your job too. Learn more about The Responsive Method , our company values , and the generous benefits we offer. <br><br></li></ul><strong>Our technology<br></strong>Our sole product is the Aha! web application. It is a single-instance, multi-tenant Ruby on Rails monolith supported by Postgres (database), Redis (background jobs), and memcached (Rails caching). We also run a Node.js webserver to support collaborative editing and real-time updates. Our application is hosted on Amazon Web Services and architected with ECS for reproducibility and scalability.<br><br>We utilize a growing amount of React on the front end to build rich client-side experiences, including our fully collaborative text editor and our slide presentation editor. We balance the strengths of both technologies — Rails for its conventions and simplicity and React for more powerful interactive functionality.<br><br>We embrace new technologies that help us deliver a lovable product, but we also remain cognizant of the maintenance overhead that a new library or platform brings. We solve the problems in front of us rather than prematurely optimizing to address issues that may never materialize.<br><br>We do most of our collaboration and planning in Aha! itself, which we find especially rewarding. We also utilize GitHub, Slack, and GoToMeeting for video calls.<br><br><strong><u>Your Experience<br><br></u></strong>We believe that being a kind person who elevates the rest of the team is just as valuable as writing great code. You have strong problem-solving skills and experience working on important functionality for a cloud-based product. You are humble, eager to learn, and always willing to help others learn as well. You want to work with people who enjoy picking up a problem and solving it, regardless of the technologies and techniques involved.<br><br>Most of our features involve writing significant Ruby on Rails code, so you have meaningful past experience working in a Rails codebase. We also write a lot of React, but we are happy to help you learn that part on the job.<br><br><strong>Your work at Aha!<br></strong>We work on a broad range of features across the full stack. Your work will include:<br><ul><li>Implementing new features for our users, touching each layer of the MVC as needed</li><li>Building deeply interactive reporting interfaces using React</li><li>Working proactively with product and UX to refine and iterate on specifications as the feature takes shape</li><li>Investigating slow performance and optimizing queries to ensure Aha! is snappy and satisfying to use</li><li>Interfacing directly with users to quickly squash bugs as part of our regular <u> customer support rotation </u> </li><li>Documenting components in our style guide to help drive consistency<br><br></li></ul>If this sounds appealing, we would love to hear from you.
