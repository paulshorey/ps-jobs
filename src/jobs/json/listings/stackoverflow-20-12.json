And, together we run a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.romanian-companies.eu/vertigo-studio-srl-29109287/\" rel=\"nofollow\">profitable<\/a> and bootstrapped business specializing in WordPress theme development.&nbsp;<\/p><br /><p>We&rsquo;re not serial entrepreneurs and we don&rsquo;t think we are the biggest, brightest developers tackling the biggest technical challenges on the planet.&nbsp;<\/p><br /><p>But we think companies have unique DNA; VertiStudio is our means to express ourselves in our professional lives.&nbsp;<\/p><br /><p>What makes us different?<\/p><br /><p>It&rsquo;s not a product, a methodology, or a one-page manifesto.<\/p><br /><p>It&rsquo;s through hundreds of little things that we&rsquo;re different.&nbsp;<\/p><br /><p><strong>What will you be working on?<\/strong><\/p><br /><p>It depends on your interests &amp; experience.&nbsp;<\/p><br /><p>We have 3 major projects:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://themeisle.com/themes/neve/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Neve<\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://optimole.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Optimole<\/a> &amp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://vertistudio.com/#vertistudio-portfolio\" rel=\"nofollow\">our own sites<\/a>, and our products are being used by around 1 million people.

They like to get to the bottom of the problem. They use the latest technologies, but they&rsquo;re realistic enough to figure out how it fits the project.<\/p><br /><p>Take this example: https://github.com/Codeinwp/neve/issues/1989&nbsp;<\/p><br /><p>Or the time an intern used a small internal hackathon as an opportunity to learn a new programming language by asking &ldquo;can the blocks be made in exotic programming languages like PureScript, F# with Fable or Elm?&rdquo;<\/p><br /><p>For this particular role, you&rsquo;ll need to understand WordPress really really well, have experience in leading a small team or at least running a major project on your own &amp; have strong PHP &amp; Javascript knowledge.<\/p><br /><p><strong>How to apply?<\/strong><\/p><br /><p>Use the form below and clearly state in a written or video form :&nbsp;<\/p><br /><ul><br /><li><br /><p>Your experience with WordPress development.<\/p><br /><\/li><br /><li><br /><p>What is your favorite code performance tweak &amp; show us some code you&rsquo;ve written that you&rsquo;re proud of if possible<\/p><br /><\/li><br /><li><br /><p>Tell us a bit about yourself and why you should be considered.<\/p><br /><\/li><br /><li><br /><p>Profile links with code samples (GitHub, GitLab, WordPress.org, etc).<\/p><br /><\/li><br /><li><br /><p>Other profile links if available (Your website, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc).<\/p><br /><\/li><br /><li><br /><p>A technical improvement that you&rsquo;ll do on https://github.com/Codeinwp/neve<\/p><br /><\/li><br /><\/ul><br /><p>Please take your time to go through those and answer carefully, we don&rsquo;t have a long interview process, nor any technical tests per se, we&rsquo;ll need those answers and references to go through them and figure out your technical skills.<\/p><br /><p>Note: I won&rsquo;t be able to individually respond to all applications, if you&rsquo;re a match we&rsquo;ll reach out.<\/p><br /><p>What does the process look like?<\/p><br /><p>If you seem to be the right person, I will reach out to you for a quick 30&rsquo; meeting. &nbsp;I would like to learn more about what you are looking for and answer your questions, alternatively, we can do this via text as well.&nbsp;<\/p><br /><p>If we agree to move forward, then the next step would be a chat with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/selul\" rel=\"nofollow\">Marius<\/a>, our CTO, about the technical work you&rsquo;ve done and what you would like to do.<\/p><br /><p>If this goes well, we&rsquo;d move into the 2-week paid trial to see how things would work.<\/p><br /><p>If this goes well, you&rsquo;re hired.<\/p>",

We know that the quicker people can get their thoughts down and get buy-in from teammates, the sooner they can get back to the deep work that makes a difference.<\/p><br /><p>We&rsquo;ve been moving fast since we founded Almanac in January 2019 and raised a $9M+ from leading Silicon Valley investors.

You want to be challenged, week on week.<\/p><br /><p>You know that your technical skills are a means to an end: delivering features for our users. You know the sequence is &ldquo;make it work, make it right, make it fast&rdquo;. You have opinions based on the products you&rsquo;ve built throughout your career, but you&rsquo;re not dogmatic on technology choices or precious about code.

Engineers develop an app (vetting available in React Web, React Native, or Node...or all of them!) and discuss it with one of our real, human experts - no whiteboarding or algorithms. Your app and follow up conversation not only grant you access to available contracts, but are displayed proudly on your profile so that&nbsp;potential clients can see what you can do.&nbsp;Say goodbye to hunting for work, waiting on late payments,&nbsp;complex contracts and paperwork, and working on dying tech - we handle all&nbsp;that stuff so you can do what you do best.&nbsp;<\/p><br /><p>G2i is short for \"Good News to the Internet.\" We are convinced that our primary vision &amp; mission are good news to companies that need to hire engineers. While we are going about fulfilling that primary vision &amp; mission, we will also be good news to those in need. We are on a mission to help hundreds of street kids&nbsp;in Nairobi, Kenya obtain education, a safe home,&nbsp;parental care, and the love they need. We are also committed to supporting the open-source community by finding ways to financially support those who build the OSS we rely on.<\/p><br /><p><strong>Your background<\/strong><\/p><br /><p>In simple terms we want engineers that take pride in their craft, are never satisfied with their knowledge base, and get excited about building applications in React, React Native, and/or Node. We look for people comfortable working in dynamic engineering environments and display strong communication and documentation skills. Here is what this actually means to us:<\/p><br /><ul><br /><li>You have 1+ years of professional development experience and have at least 1 year of React Native and/or React production experience.<\/li><br /><li>You want to blow us away with your skillset&nbsp;- our code challenge often takes 6-8 hours to complete&nbsp;within ~7 days.&nbsp;<\/li><br /><li>You are fluent in both verbal and written English and are comfortable communicating directly with technical and non-technical clients.<\/li><br /><li>You are available 30-40 hours per week.<\/li><br /><li>You might have&nbsp;other experience with Rails, Python, Apollo Client/GraphQL,&nbsp;native Android (Java, Kotlin) or iOS (Objective C, Swift). But if you don't, that's OK too!<\/li><br /><li>You have prior experience as a freelancer or are someone that enjoys having the freedom to choose the types of projects that best align with your interests. You also understand that freelancing can come with potential downtime.<\/li><br /><li>You are flexible and can adjust to the working styles of different teams. Some teams may want to pair-program and have daily interaction others may want engineers to work independently and only interact a few hours per week.<\/li><br /><\/ul><br /><p><strong>Vetting - Developers and Clients<\/strong><\/p><br /><p>G2i also vets clients so that you'll be contracting with clients that place a high value on engineering and focus on running healthy projects. We take care of contracts, billing, payments and all of the other work that goes into freelancing so that engineers can focus on code and clients on building their product. Our vision is for the hiring process to be simple, trustworthy and enjoyable for both companies and engineers.<\/p><br /><p>When we vet clients we make sure they:<\/p><br /><ul><br /><li>Prioritize communication<\/li><br /><li>Plan appropriately and have realistic timelines<\/li><br /><li>Understand the cost of healthy development and have a budget to pay for it<\/li><br /><\/ul><br /><p>When we vet engineers we make sure:<\/p><br /><ul><br /><li>Engineers vet other engineers<\/li><br /><li>Our code challenges are to the point and based on production-level code, no whiteboarding<\/li><br /><li>Our process is objective, repeatable and quantitively scored<\/li><br /><li>Our process is completely transparent<\/li><br /><\/ul><br /><p><strong>Who you will work with<\/strong><\/p><br /><p>We only work with companies that value engineers and run healthy engineering teams. We regularly partner with&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ycombinator.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Y Combinator<\/a>&nbsp;funded product companies that place a high value on engineering. Some of the companies we have worked with are: Lattice, Major League Soccer, ZeeMee, Software Engineering Daily, and Truebill with new clients coming in weekly.<\/p><br /><p><strong>Diversity<\/strong><\/p><br /><p>G2i is an equal opportunity employer.

And now were recruiting the remaining pieces of this world-class team as we get ready to launch two major strategic initiatives to introduce our new brand:  our state-of-the-art e-commerce website and customized metabolic optimization app that leverages machine learning and AI.  We couldnt be more excited to build this dedicated digital optimization team because it means we can move lightning fast. <\/p><p>If youre as obsessed with testing as I am, this is a dream-scenario.  I joined the company because I wanted to be part of building their new brand, to build something special, to build it the <em>right<\/em> way.  But building things the right way is a constant process of optimization. And to do that we need the help of a world-class UI/UX front-end developer who can help us rapidly iterate. <\/p><p>Thats why this is a fantastic opportunity for someone with an inquisitive, consumer-oriented mindset whos oozing with ideas and obsessed with creating amazing user experiences that convert like crazy.  You get annoyed when pixels arent perfect and when UXs and UIs dont make sense and scratch your head when you buy something on another website or app and wonder why their checkout process is so inefficient! You love to get creative and your first instinct at a challenge is never it cant be done but rather Ill figure it out  and then you deliver and make it happen. <\/p><p>Sure, we need someone who can carve up mockups but were looking for so much more.  We want your ideas!  We want to tap into your creative problem-solving brain to improve overall usability and to smartly leverage technology to make everything faster, more scalable, smoother, and easier. Youll work with the CRO director, UX/UI designer, copywriter and other SWAT team members to develop hypotheses, propose treatments, collaboratively build tests, analyze results for key learnings and repeat. <\/p><p>Your days will be exciting and filled with variety. One day you might be optimizing a quiz in our performance funnels another day you may be optimizing a checkout or upsell page our e-comm website another day you might be optimizing the onboarding experience in our customized metabolic optimization app. <\/p><p><strong>Whats Our Culture Like?<\/strong> <\/p><p>Were serious about high-performance, <strong>so our culture is built around deep work<\/strong> to allow uninterrupted time for the intense concentration needed to deliver world-class performance.  At the same time, real collaboration and transparency is critical to keep us all in alignment and keep office politics out of the equation.  These arent just talking points  weve implemented specific policies, for example: <\/p><ul> <li>A standardized 8:30 to 5:00 p.m. ET schedule to protect your <strong>personal and family time<\/strong> <\/li> <li>No meetings before 1 p.m. ET to empower you with 4 hours truly of <strong>deep work to GSD<\/strong> <\/li> <li>Daily huddles and weekly 1-on-1s to support your ability to <strong>focus on what matters most<\/strong> <\/li> <\/ul><p> <br><strong>Should You Apply?<\/strong> <\/p><p>If after reading this its screaming this is for me and <\/p><ul> <li>You LOVE split testing and are completely addicted to testing and learning <\/li> <li>You LOVE tinkering with user interfaces until theyre just right <\/li> <li>You LOVE writing clean, efficient code that turns Zeplin mockups into pixel-perfect executions <\/li> <li>You LOVE figuring out how to create fast-loading websites and apps with the best tech <\/li> <li>You LOVE being part of a cross-functional high-performing team that moves fast <\/li> <\/ul><p> <br>Then please read on as youre the ideal candidate and wed love to talk to you ASAP. <\/p><p><strong>What Does Metabolic Living Do?<\/strong> <\/p><p>The most common question we get is  what the heck do you do?  Because from the outside in, unless youre a customer, it can be confusing,  Theres a reason:  We built everything organically in reverse, starting with our first nutrition program in 2012, then our first exercise program in 2014 and then launching our full ecosystem of products, including nutraceuticals, functional foods, subscriptions, memberships, 1-on-1 coaching and more.  These are all marketed separately under different DTC websites and brands in a direct response (DR) manner. <\/p><p>And now were centralizing everything under our new brand, Metabolic Living, with our flagship website and app launching later this year, transitioning us from purely DR to a multi-channel traditional brand.  The website at metabolicliving.com is a temporary one for COVID to raise $45k for frontline health workers. This website will be replaced with the fully branded e-commerce-driven one soon. <\/p><p>Normally, companies launch with a brand and then figure out how to make money.  We did that in reverse  pinpointing pain points, curating world-class products, validating product-market match, generating cash flow to self-fund our growth, creating our north star (see more below), building out our operational team along the way and then retrofitting the brand on top.  Strange path, but here we are.

We avoid meetings and regard email as a necessary communication tool.&nbsp; The languages we use are mostly Ruby on Rails, Javascript, and CoffeeScript.&nbsp; PostgreSQL is our main data store while MS-SQL is used for customer integrations. The tools we lean on are Cucumber, Rspec, GitHub and CircleCI.&nbsp; Our migration to the Google Cloud platform is underway.<\/p><br /><p>Your average day will start with checking in with the team and making sure no one has any immediate needs.&nbsp; Usually there aren't any. You'll then be able to focus on your engineering tasks. As a full stack engineer this will include direct engineering work on the product, SQL based client integrations, code reviews and DevOps related work. You will be expected to make progress in a self-directed fashion without micromanagement. At the end of each day you should feel good about your work product, the company's direction and enjoy your free time.<\/p><br /><p>You need to be eligible to work in the United States.&nbsp; If you're interested please submit your resume.

We are always looking for practical people who love writing highly optimized code that straddles the line between research and software development.

We&rsquo;ve been around since 1991, and we&rsquo;re still going strong.&nbsp;<\/p><br /><p>Our ideal developers thrive in the environment of variety and challenge that is inherent to custom software development, working with us in a long-term relationship over many projects for numerous clients.<\/p><br /><p>Since we do custom software development, the skills and needs for each project can vary widely. This goes beyond just the languages we use, to the industries and problem domains we work in. We look for generalists; most importantly those who are excited to learn and take on new challenges. You can expect to grow both in your strength and your versatility when working here. We want to help you do so.<\/p><br /><p>We work remotely all over the United States and Canada. We expect you to be able to work well on your own and comfortably with teams. You won&rsquo;t have someone looking over your shoulder so you'll need to be communicative and reliable, and hold yourself accountable. We depend on each other.<\/p><br /><p>Art+Logic is run by humans, who work and create using technology. Things can go wrong and we need to respond to the unexpected by being kind, considerate, fair, flexible, and calm. We treat our clients and peers as respectfully as we would like to be treated.<\/p><br /><p>Here&rsquo;s an example of some projects we&rsquo;ve worked on recently, so you can better understand the wide range of projects and challenges we undertake:<\/p><br /><ul><br /><li>Implementing a Django-based DoD CAC card login<\/li><br /><li>Writing a data model layer using SQLAlchemy to provide an object-oriented view of a legacy relational database schema. This model layer provides all business rules and data integrity using advanced python3 features. This data model in turn serves a REST API (python-pyramid) consumed by an advanced single-page web application written with Marionette (Backbone)<\/li><br /><li>Created Windows tablet application to communicate with client's modbus hardware and upload data to Python/Django/Vue webapp for analysis and display<\/li><br /><\/ul><br /><p><strong>What we want from you: (aka: skills)<\/strong><\/p><br /><p>We currently have a high demand for Python, specifically Django, and JavaScript web framework experience.&nbsp;<\/p><br /><p>However, more important than that, we are looking for people who are curious and looking for opportunities to learn. People who like learning and creating on their own. Those who are able to drive themselves or even lead others when completing projects. Developers who are able to organize and express their ideas. Communication is paramount here.<\/p><br /><p><strong>Relationship Details:<\/strong><\/p><br /><p>We are looking for Contractors (1099) for long term open-ended relationships. Work hours are flexible; requiring reasonable overlap with normal working hours to support team communications, and not just nights and weekends. Our rates range from $35-$55/hour. We are ONLY looking for people in the United States and Canada.<\/p><br /><p>We want you to enjoy working for us, and to be able to have a life outside of work. Since you're not commuting you can embrace the freedom of working from where you enjoy living, and use the saved time for your personal life and relationships. We don&rsquo;t ask our developers to work consistently over 40 hours/week.&nbsp;<\/p><br /><p>It&rsquo;s important to us in the hiring process that we allow developers to demonstrate their abilities by actually developing something, because a list of previous employers or educational background aren&rsquo;t always indicators of what someone can do. All applicants are asked to submit a solution to a programming challenge that emulates a task we might assign on a project.&nbsp;<\/p>",

Olo benefits from the fact that over half of our workforce is remote, therefore we are accustomed to conducting interviews via video conferencing and we anticipate no impact on our recruiting timelines. We encourage candidates to share any concerns or questions with Olo&rsquo;s recruiting team.<\/p>",
