It was always an employee care company,” said Sean Kelly, Caroo’s CEO.</div><div></div><br>\n<div>\nWe now live in a work-from-anywhere economy. In this new world, employees and employers are facing new challenges. Work culture is rapidly evolving and leaders are trying to determine how to take care of their teams. Outdated and expensive employee care solutions focus solely on the physical office space and are one-size-fits-all. Only one option exists to provide economical, personalized care in the work-from-anywhere world, which requires data, AI and forecasting to be most effective and efficient.</div><div></div><br>\n<div>\nTo take advantage of this opportunity and leverage the company's current positioning and core competencies, Caroo is expanding beyond food and drink delivery to become a software-enabled employee care platform that will manage and deliver all of a company's tangible care needs. Over the past few months, the company has already signed up more than 3,000 new enterprise clients with their various wellness box solutions. A product-zeitgeist fit exists, and Caroo is focused on becoming the market leader in this new world of work.</div><div></div><br>\n<div>\nCaroo curates healthier snacks, premium gifts, and team building experiences which it is delivering via its own software and technology platform. The shift comes after the dramatic shift to remote work due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Because work is far less office-centric, it has launched such products as an Inspire Collection and Amplify Box, products which are designed to help work-from-anywhere employees feel inspired, cared for, and appreciated. Those offerings include curated healthy snacks and beverages, gifts, and team-building experiences all designed to connect employees, recognize them (celebrations, anniversaries, birthdays, onboarding), and nourish them month-over-month.</div><div></div><br>\n<div><b>\nThe Role:</b></div><div></div><br>\n<div>\nCaroo is looking for a talented, self-starting technologist looking for a new, exciting chapter that will challenge you to become a better DevOps engineer while also helping millions of people across America live healthier.

It was always an employee care company,” said Sean Kelly, Caroo’s CEO.</div><div></div><br>\n<div>\nWe now live in a work-from-anywhere economy. In this new world, employees and employers are facing new challenges. Work culture is rapidly evolving and leaders are trying to determine how to take care of their teams. Outdated and expensive employee care solutions focus solely on the physical office space and are one-size-fits-all. Only one option exists to provide economical, personalized care in the work-from-anywhere world, which requires data, AI and forecasting to be most effective and efficient.</div><div></div><br>\n<div>\nTo take advantage of this opportunity and leverage the company's current positioning and core competencies, Caroo is expanding beyond food and drink delivery to become a software-enabled employee care platform that will manage and deliver all of a company's tangible care needs. Over the past few months, the company has already signed up more than 3,000 new enterprise clients with their various wellness box solutions. A product-zeitgeist fit exists, and Caroo is focused on becoming the market leader in this new world of work.</div><div></div><br>\n<div>\nCaroo curates healthier snacks, premium gifts, and team building experiences which it is delivering via its own software and technology platform. The shift comes after the dramatic shift to remote work due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Because work is far less office-centric, it has launched such products as an Inspire Collection and Amplify Box, products which are designed to help work-from-anywhere employees feel inspired, cared for, and appreciated. Those offerings include curated healthy snacks and beverages, gifts, and team-building experiences all designed to connect employees, recognize them (celebrations, anniversaries, birthdays, onboarding), and nourish them month-over-month.</div><div></div><br>\n<div>\nAs Caroo rebrands and enters an expanded market, with a significant expansion of product SKUs and a much larger, more ambitious tech strategy, they are seeking an <b>Engineering Manager</b> with a proven track record of success leading a team of talented engineers.</div><div>\n</div><div>\nThe engineering mission of Caroo is to build a scalable, resilient, and secure platform to serve both its enterprise and individual customers.

Your work at AllStripes will directly affect people diagnosed with serious rare illnesses by connecting patients and their data to the researchers who are actively developing treatments. This job requires cultivating a deep empathy and understanding of the challenges that patients face in seeking treatment, and a strong desire to improve medical research and drug development for the better.</p>\n<p>\nWe currently have two main projects: our external patient-facing product and our internal clinical operations platform. You will have the opportunity to develop and own new features across both projects. Our stack includes React, Parse Platform (an ORM backed by Postgres), and NodeJS, though you don’t have to be an expert with these specific technologies to apply. We are creating a positive, inclusive, and collaborative engineering culture of technical excellence. We pride ourselves on being resourceful, and we roll up our sleeves and pitch in where we are needed. We are playful and curious about code, research, and building a great company.

Your expertise will help you bridge the gap between graphical design and technical implementation, taking an active role on both sides and defining how the site or application looks as well as how it works.</p>\n<h2 class=\"jobSectionHeader\"><b>\nResponsibilities?</b></h2>\n<p>\nYou’ll have several. You’ll be responsible for designing beautiful but usable designs and interfaces for clients. You’ll oversee the recommendation and implementation of WordPress plugins as well as the development of custom user-facing features. You’ll create reusable code and assemble libraries for future use. You’ll work with our QA team to ensure the technical feasibility of UI/UX designs, and you’ll also work with our tech team to optimize any custom applications for maximum speed and scalability.</p>\n<p>\nTo pull this off, you’ll need to have a good understanding of Conversion-centric design. We’re not about creating designs that entertain the designer. We’re about creating designs that convert visitors into customers. So, your expertise in building funnels and website conversion opportunities will be critical to the success of our clients.</p>\n<p>\nYou need to be a team player who is passionate about learning, teaching, serving and growing. This industry changes fast, so if you like change, strap on and hold tight, because we push change to its maximum every day.</p>\n<h2 class=\"jobSectionHeader\"><b>\nSkills And Qualifications</b></h2>\n<p>\nYou definitely need to know your way around Photoshop and Illustrator, plus you’ll need to know how to build a WordPress site with as little custom CSS as possible. The goal is to leverage the power that is built into WordPress and not build every page independently of the CMS. When it comes time to make a site or application really sing, though, you’ll need to demonstrate your proficient understanding of web markup, including HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, and JavaScript.</p>\n<p>\nIdeally, you’d have a great understanding of designing using Thrive Architect, Divi, or WP Bakery. You’ll also need a good understanding of SEO principles and ensure that our clients’ websites will adhere to them.</p>\n<p>\nOh, and you’ll not only need to be creative, but you’re going to need to be fast. We have the need for speed at Bizzuka, because our clients depend on us to help them increase revenues and decrease expenses by automating lead generation or automating manual processes. The sooner we fix their problems, the more of an impact we can have on their business and the customers they serve.</p>\n<p>\nOur clients expect and deserve the best. If that sounds like something you can get behind, then attach your resume with a link to your portfolio of work.\n</p></div><div></div><div><div><div><div><b>Job Category: </b>Graphic/Web Design\n</div><div><b>Job Type: </b>Full Time</div></div></div></div></div></div><div id=\"belowFullJobDescription\" class=\"mosaic mosaic-empty-zone\"></div>\n<b> Meta: Bizzuka, Inc. - 4 days ago</b><br />\n<b> Company: Bizzuka, Inc. - Lafayette, LA 70506</b><br />\n<b> Employer: Bizzuka, Inc.</b><br />",

No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!\n<br>But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)\n<br>Day to day, we focus on the give and take.

Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.\n<br>So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots?

CX makes setting up, managing, and maintaining that infrastructure easier than it has ever been before.\n<br>As a Full Stack Engineer on the CX Engineering &amp; Product Incubation organization, within the Insights &amp; Engineering Rapid Response Team, you will help design, prototype, and build features for CX Cloud. From CX Cloud our customers can control their entire technology stack: access points, switches, firewalls, client devices, cameras, and more. You will work across the stack with directly with customers, other developers, UX designers, and product management to build and improve the web application. Customer Experience engineers put the customer experience first, and are empowered to make impactful decisions.\n<br>We believe that the quality of our product is dependent on the quality of our engineers. We place a high value on nurturing the growth and development of everyone on our team. We foster an open and supportive workplace where everybody is given the opportunity to succeed. Who You’ll Work With\n<br>You will work cross functionally with CX Engineering, collaborating with multiple teams and developing best in class solutions. As the needs of Cisco’s top customers and partners are constantly evolving, we’ll work directly with their engineering teams to understand needs, and rapidly design, prototype, and deploy solutions.\n<br>The Insights &amp; Engineering Rapid Response Team is focused on solving tough problems that directly impact customers and increase value proposition. This in turn drives improvements in recurring revenue, cost savings and sales effectiveness for Cisco and its partners. Who You Are\n<br><br>\n<b>Example projects of a Full Stack Web Developer:</b><br>\nBuild minimal viable prototypes to demonstrate business case with and for customers Implement testing mechanisms to ensure reliability\n<br>Improve performance and efficiency of our backend, allowing us to handle increasingly large datasets with minimal delay Build internal frameworks and refine front end infrastructure\n<br><br>\n<b>You are an outstanding applicant if:</b><br>\nYou have a technical degree or equivalent experience with a strong foundation in the fundamentals of computer science\n<br>You strive to build rich and dynamic web applications with front-end frameworks such as React, Redux, Ember, or Angular\n<br>You are familiar with programming languages and web frameworks like Java (Springboot), Golang, Python (Django, Flask), or Node.js (Express) You have worked with SQL and relational Databases\n<br>You would flourish within a small engineering team and are excited to tackle open-ended problems\n<br>Startup experience, early stage web app development, agile software development We Are Cisco\n<br>#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.\n<br>We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!\n<br>But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)\n<br>Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.\n<br>So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool.\n<br>#LI-CD1</div><div id=\"belowFullJobDescription\" class=\"mosaic mosaic-empty-zone\"></div>\n<b> Meta: Cisco Systems - 4 days ago</b><br />\n<b> Company: Cisco Systems</b><br />\n<b> Employer: Cisco Systems</b><br />",

Your workload will be manageable.</li>\n<li>Flexible time: Once our clients' needs are met, our time is our own to structure.

When you're on vacation, we'll only contact you if things will Literally Fall Apart without you for a few days, and even that as minimally as possible.

You will have the opportunity to work with one of the following teams:</p><ul><li>\nThe Marketer Experience team</li><li>\nUnity Workflow</li><li>\nAnalytics &amp; Data Vizualization</li></ul><p></p><p>\nYou will have direct access to end-users and stakeholders, and you are encouraged to build and leverage these relationships in your work. You will write and test your code, and work with our QA team to get it deployed to production. With the help of a homegrown, bot-driven CI/CD pipeline, your code will be delivered to users daily.</p><p></p><p>\nAside from the day to day, we can offer you incredible benefits including an annual continuing education budget, a trust-focused development process, a flexible and collaborative work environment where balance matters, stock ownership, and an annual company retreat.</p><p></p><p>\nThe team strives to be ego-free and motivated only by building amazing software for our users. We seek to understand the \"why\" behind the \"what\". We regularly break out into small teams to tackle problems, learn new technologies, or just share what we know with others. We test our code and invest in the health of our systems. We push each other, learn from each other, and strive to continually grow.</p><p></p><br>\n<p><b>\nPrimary Responsibilities</b></p><p></p><p>\nYou will...</p><ul><li>\nWork with stakeholders to define the solutions to development problems and business requirements</li><li>\nDevelop and maintain customer-focused features and capabilities for the IZEAx platform</li><li>\nCreate unit and integration tests for your code</li><li>\nReproduce and fix bugs reported by internal and external users</li><li>\nSet goals and communicate often about your progress toward them</li><li>\nContribute to the ongoing improvement of the Engineering organization and our software<br>\n</li></ul><p></p><p><b>\nWhat We’re Looking For</b></p><p></p><p>\nA problem solver at heart</p><ul><li><i>\nMuch of our work revolves around problems that have no existing off-the-shelf solution or consensus on best practices. You'll often need to break down large problems into smaller more manageable tasks and utilize critical thinking to come up with novel ideas.</i><br>\n</li></ul><p>\n1+ years of web development experience</p><ul><li><i>\nThe internet is a complicated place. A general understanding of what it means to develop software that is delivered over the web will serve you well and should include things like HTTP, CORS, DNS, and SSL. Ideally, you know what a load balancer is, understand stateless client-server application architecture, and can speak about the browser's DOM.</i><br>\n</li></ul><p>\n1+ years professional development experience with CSS, semantic HTML &amp; Javascript</p><ul><li><i>\nThis will be your day to day work. While we use frameworks to assist in the development of our applications, browsers understand CSS, HTML, and Javascript. You may skew more towards CSS, or more towards JS, but to get the job done, you should understand how they all fit together.</i><br>\n</li></ul><p>\nExperience with a JavaScript Framework like AngularJS, React, Vue, or EmberJS</p><ul><li><i>\nModern, API-driven web applications are large and complex, and IZEAx is no different. To help developers stay sane, frameworks have emerged to keep code bases in check. At IZEA, we use EmberJS. If you haven't used EmberJS before, it's ok; we are confident you can pick it up (and like it) if you have used one of these other frameworks.</i></li></ul><p><br>\nExperience with a CSS preprocessor like Sass or LESS</p><ul><li><i>\nFor the same reason that we use a framework and tooling for Javascript, we use Sass to help manage the complexity that comes with a large code base that has many contributing developers. If you've used LESS instead, that's cool, we just want you to be ready for using a preprocessor and understand some of the advantages of it.</i><br>\n</li></ul><p>\nBasic Linux skills</p><ul><li><i>\nIn order to develop for IZEAx, you need to run it on your laptop. This means opening up some terminal windows, running some commands, and keeping the log output open. Additionally, some of our technology stack is better accessed through CLIs. Examples include the Ember CLI, the Rails CLI/console, Docker commands, Gradle, and our own gemstone architecture CLI. We'll walk you through it, but you should be comfy in a terminal.</i><br>\n</li></ul><p>\nAbility to multitask and prioritize multiple incoming requests</p><ul><li><i>\nIZEA's Engineering team strives to provide a great experience and great service to our users. In order to do that, you may need to context switch into a support issue or drop what you are doing to start work on something else. This is part of what Agile means to us.</i><br>\n</li></ul><p>\nExcellent verbal and written communications skills</p><ul><li><i>\nRegular and timely communication is the key to a trust based development process. You should be able to simply and concisely ask for feedback and direction in terms that your audience understands, and relay requested information in a timely fashion to your leaders. You should prioritize documentation of processes and code.</i><br>\n</li></ul><p></p><p><b>\nDemonstrated experience with the following will be highly valued</b></p><p></p><p>\nInterface &amp; Experience Design</p><ul><li><i>\nWorking on the front end, you inherently get an over-sized say in the user's experience with our software. Attention to detail, quality, usability, accessibility, standards, and trends in interface design will help you succeed at IZEA.</i><br>\n</li></ul><p>\nAmazon Web Services, or other cloud providers</p><ul><li><i>\nIZEA's software is hosted on AWS, and you will need to acquire some familiarity with it. Previous experience in using a cloud provider, even if just for developer tooling, shows that you understand some of the nuances involved in working in the cloud.</i><br>\n</li></ul><p>\nRuby on Rails and NodeJS</p><ul><li><i>\nInevitably, your work on the front end will involve tweaking, or adding an API to our core back-end services. Since these services are written in Ruby on Rails and NodeJS, experience here will help you understand the greater technology deployment, and how the front end applications are served data.</i><br>\n</li></ul><p>\nGitHub</p><ul><li><i>\nAll of IZEA's code is source controlled on Github. We leverage Github Pull Requests for code reviews, Github integrations manage parts of our CI/CD pipeline, and Github releases define the code tags that ultimately get deployed. Much of our process documentation exists on Github pages. Familiarity with navigating Github's features will help you ramp up in our SDLC faster.</i><br>\n</li></ul><p>\nJIRA</p><ul><li><i>\nIZEA uses JIRA to manage projects and report on progress to stakeholders inside and outside the company. While we strive to automate as much of JIRA as possible with bots, webhooks and reports, understanding how JIRA issues, links, attachments, and workflows work will help you understand our SDLC faster.</i><br>\n</li></ul><p><b>\nAbout IZEA</b>:</p><p></p><p>\nWe are IZEA: The Creator Marketplace. Our cloud-based technologies connect Brands and Publishers with content Creators who blog, tweet, pin, and post on their behalf.</p><p></p><p>\nOur driving belief is that the only way to thrive in our rapidly changing world is to change ahead of it. IZEA is in a constant state of evolution and reinvention. While we may have invented the industry, we still operate like an entrepreneurial, scrappy start-up.
