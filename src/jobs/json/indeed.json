Sometimes this will involve creating visual elements within a client’s existing brand, while at other times your design work will be more greenfield.</p><p></p><br>\n<p>\nYou will work closely with your web developer colleagues to ensure a proper and hassle-free implementation; they will be doing most of the code work for your designs. However, web designers should feel comfortable using semantic HTML5 and CSS/Sass when needed, and be able to support those aspects of the design.\n</p><p>This role will report to the Implementation Team Manager within Customer Success and be part of a squad with visual design and web development skills. In addition, you’ll work closely with designers in other parts of the company to continue to build out a ‘design community of practice’ at OpenCities that supports best-in-class visual, experience, and service design.

You love working with clients to bring them along for the creative process, and you know how to be an advocate for user-centered best practice in conversations with non-designers. You understand what is needed to make a website functional and easy to use, but at the same time make it aesthetically appealing to the user. And of course, your visual designs show attention to detail, consistency, and reflect today’s best practice and style.</p><p></p><br>\n<p><b>\nIn addition, you’ll exhibit many of these qualities:</b></p><p>\nA creative approach to problem solving and aptitude for analyzing constraints and strategizing for better solutions</p><p>\nExceptional communication abilities, effectively summarizing results to create a compelling case for user-centered design decisions</p><p>\nA strong online portfolio showcasing design work for the web</p><p>\nStrong command of color theory, image composition, and typography</p><p>\nProven experience working with a team to iterate and implement projects</p><p>\nDemonstrated ability to take a project from concept to launch</p><p>\nA clear understanding of web design fundamentals and systems, such as interface style guides, responsive design, grid systems, front-end frameworks, and accessibility best practices</p><p></p><br>\n<p><b>\nBonus points:</b></p><p>\nExperience working with local or state government, non-profits, or in GovTech</p><p>\nExperience designing for content management systems</p><p>\nExperience developing with HTML/CSS/JavaScript</p><p>\nExperience working remotely in a fast-paced startup, quickly growing and maturing</p><p></p><br>\n<p><b>\nABOUT US</b></p><p>\nWhat started out as a bespoke website shop for a handful of government clients has since transformed to the OpenCities SaaS platform, built with and for government. We provide the website and forms functionality modern governments need to transform their digital customer journey without custom coding.</p><p></p><br>\n<p>\nWe take pride in building flexible and accessible products that help local governments reimagine how to build, deliver and evolve their website and online services. We know the work we do matters because our products power millions of resident interactions around the world and we’re only getting started.

Roku pioneered streaming to the TV. Our mission is to be the TV streaming platform that connects the entire TV ecosystem. We connect consumers to the content they love, enable content publishers to build and monetize large audiences, and provide advertisers unique capabilities to engage consumers.</p><br>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nFrom your first day at Roku, you'll make a valuable — and valued — contribution. We're a fast-growing public company where no one is a bystander. We offer you the opportunity to delight millions of TV streamers around the world, while gaining meaningful experience across a variety of disciplines.</p><br>\n<p></p>\n<h3 class=\"jobSectionHeader\"><b>\nAbout the role</b></h3><br>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nRoku is looking for an experienced UX Engineer to partner with our UX Designers and Researchers to create interactive prototypes of our TV, Mobile, and Web products so we can evaluate and iterate features we're building for our tens of millions of users around the world.</p><br>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nRoku has become famous for making sure each feature and product is as perfect as it can be (just look at our remote control or user interface) while still pushing the boundaries of what it means to watch TV. In order to help ship features and products, you will partner with product management and engineering leaders to innovate and deliver features and capabilities across the Roku platform, while maintaining the integrity and cohesiveness of our user experience. Great candidates are comfortable with ambiguity, though that isn't code for \"sloppy.\" Even when you aren't sure, you should move forward precisely and quickly knowing that action creates its own certainty. And because everyone here is empowered, your performance at Roku tends to come from getting others to embrace your idea. It's the most collaborative people who can drop their ego in service of their customers and create the win-win of success for our customers.</p><br>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nAs an UX Engineer, you'll be expected to look at what exists and find ways to make it better. We're always in \"build mode\" because we're a company of data-focused builders, especially on the UX team.</p><br>\n<p></p><h3 class=\"jobSectionHeader\"><b>\nWhat you'll be doing</b><br>\n</h3>\n<ul><li>Partner with designers, researchers, product managers, and other cross-functional stakeholders to understand requirements and provide creative, thoughtful solutions</li>\n<li>Develop realistic prototypes to guide design decisions, user research sessions, and product demonstrations across multiple platforms: TV, mobile, web, voice, and audio</li>\n</ul><ul><li>Iterate prototypes based on feedback from research, design, and product management</li>\n<li>Collaborate closely with UX Researchers to user-test new concepts</li>\n<li>Create prototypes to explain new functionality to engineering</li>\n<li>Develop with flexibility, in order to iterate, pivot, and update prototypes quickly</li>\n<li>Develop and maintain a component library to efficiently develop prototypes at different levels of fidelity, while keeping alignment with Roku's UX design patterns</li><br>\n</ul><p></p>\n<h3 class=\"jobSectionHeader\"><b>\nWe're excited if you have</b><br>\n</h3>\n<ul><li>7+ years of experience in a technical/software development role prototyping or building consumer-facing products across web, mobile, and/or TV.</li>\n</ul><ul><li>Experience collaborating with UX design and research to build user interfaces. Proficiency with design tools such as Sketch or Adobe Creative Suite and prototyping tools such as Framer, Flinto, Principle, Adobe XD or similar are highly regarded.</li>\n<li>Experience with JavaScript frameworks (React, Vue, or similar), and server-side / cloud technologies like Node.js, Python, Ruby, MySQL, AWS or similar.</li>\n</ul><ul><li>Knowledge of frontend technologies like HTML/CSS, XML/JSON, and responsive/adaptive web principles along with the current browser landscape and APIs.</li>\n</ul><ul><li>Ability to abstract and interpret the intention of a UX design and suggest creative ways to prototype concepts rapidly.</li>\n<li>Strong communication and project management skills to work on multiple simultaneous projects.</li>\n<li>Excellent problem-solving skills and relentless attention to detail, as well as UX Design sensibilities: an eye for detail, flow, animations and usability.</li>\n</ul><ul><li>Portfolio highlighting multiple projects demonstrating end-to-end user experiences you've built (include online portfolio link with resume).</li>\n<li>While not strictly necessary, we would value someone with a background in game development or motion graphics / animation, experience modeling different types of user input, such as TV remote control, touch, and voice, and someone who can hack hardware (such as IR / BLE remote controls).</li><br>\n</ul><p></p>\n<h3 class=\"jobSectionHeader\"><b>\nOur unique culture</b></h3><br>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nRoku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.</p><br>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nWe have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.</p><br>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n#LI-PP1</p></div></div><div id=\"belowFullJobDescription\" class=\"mosaic mosaic-empty-zone\"></div>",

When we eventually reopen our Seattle office, we will continue to support remote work from Washington, New York, and California. Through 2021, we also support working remotely from Illinois, Colorado, Hawaii, and Oregon, but we may require physical relocation for employees in those states after 2021.</p>\n<p>\nTextio embraces diversity and equal opportunity in a serious way.

We sell an expanding variety of photo and home products, including photo blankets, photo books, canvases, pillows, and more. Our company has been featured on the TODAY Show, The View, and Good Morning America many times. We are a 100% employee-owned company that has rapidly grown to 60 employees and $50M annual revenue since 2013.</p>\n<h2 class=\"jobSectionHeader\"><b>\nWe are 100% Remote</b></h2>\n<p>\nAs a 100% remote company, we are set up to provide the best possible environment for engineering. The less time developers spend dealing with cumbersome processes, inefficient systems, and commuting, the more time they have to solve problems and make an impact. Collage.com's co-founders/co-CEOs both come from a technical background and believe in staying at the forefront of best practices so that we can focus on work that matters. We pass almost all of The Joel Test (we only fix high-priority bugs before writing new code, but hey, we're a start-up), use continuous deployment (code goes straight to production after each merge), and are in the process of adopting mobx-state-tree with React. Strong engineering is a key part of our business strategy - it lets us build best-in-class design tools faster than our larger competitors.</p>\n<h2 class=\"jobSectionHeader\"><b>\nThe Role</b></h2>\n<p>\nWe are seeking an ambitious and nice senior front-end engineer who shares our passion for building a great software company. This is a unique opportunity to have a major impact on our engineering team's growth (we are about ten strong right now) by helping us continually raise the bar. You will be expected to collaborate with other engineers to solve complex technical problems and push us to deliver higher quality code at an ever-increasing rate. We firmly believe in the power of solid architecture, code design, and simplicity over brute force, which is why we do our best to hire 10x senior engineers. If you are seeking an environment where you get to do meaningful work with other great engineers, then we want to hear from you.</p>\n<p>\nLearn more about working and developing software at Collage.com.</p>\n<h2 class=\"jobSectionHeader\"><b>\nResponsibilities</b></h2>\n<ul><li>Write and maintain front-end JavaScript code as part of a mobile-first web application, including UI components and state management logic.</li>\n<li>Make decisions about code design, architecture, and refactoring to balance technical debt against delivering functionality.</li>\n<li>Plan and lead testing for complex projects.</li>\n<li>Review code and mentor other engineers.</li>\n<li>Provide time estimates and participate in agile development.</li>\n<li>Review specifications and work with PMs to implement lean methodology.</li>\n</ul><h2 class=\"jobSectionHeader\"><b>Required Qualifications</b></h2>\n<ul><li>Experience implementing and testing advanced JavaScript code on a team as part of a production web or mobile application</li>\n<li>Practical experience with MV* architecture (such as Backbone, Vue, React + Redux/Mobx, etc.), unidirectional data flow, and minimal class/object interfaces</li>\n<li>Spatial/geometric reasoning ability - for rendering, animation, and image manipulation</li>\n<li>Ability to quickly understand and work with unfamiliar complex code</li>\n<li>Pro-active and clear communication is essential for this remote work position</li>\n</ul><h2 class=\"jobSectionHeader\"><b>Benefits and Perks</b></h2>\n<ul><li>Working from home makes it easier to focus on results and develop professionally while spending less time commuting.

Because you will be working remotely, all of our interviews are done remotely. We look for candidates with good written and verbal communication skills who embody our company values (which can be found on our careers page).</p>\n<p>\nDuring the interview process, you will:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Speak to a member of our talent acquisition team which will be mostly an experience and values/culture fit assessment</li>\n<li>Complete a shorter coding task that includes questions in Javascript and focuses on applying general programming concepts (like concurrency and good code structure) in realistic scenarios</li>\n<li>Speak with a Senior/Lead engineer</li>\n<li>Complete a more complex technical challenge that is intended to emulate your actual work environment</li>\n<li>Speak with our VP of engineering and both founders/CEOs of the company</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We believe in transparency, and will give you the opportunity to speak with anyone else you'd like to meet before accepting an offer.

You are culturally competent.</li>\n<li>You have broad experience with interlocking technologies: making disparate systems work together is your bread and butter.</li>\n<li>You have skill in evaluating user needs and determining how to make them real with the tools available.</li>\n<li>You are experienced at managing a CMS for website and/or online learning delivery.</li>\n<li>You know HTML and basic CSS.</li>\n<li>You are skilled at documenting workflows and supporting users.</li>\n<li>You know how to manage large meetings in Zoom, including breakout rooms and high production value.</li>\n<li>You are a charismatic public speaker for technical support in large meetings.</li>\n<li>You have an eye for graphics and are comfortable making an informative diagram or a stunning slide deck.</li>\n<li>You are a strong collaborator who pulls your weight and operates independently.</li>\n<li>You delight in the details.</li>\n<li>You practice continual improvement in your work.</li>\n</ul>\nAdditional qualities we'd love to see\n<br><br>\nWe welcome a wide array of expertise and background that complements the existing experiences on our team.

Here are some of the qualities of our workplace:\n<br><br>\n<ul>\n<li>100% Remote: The DJA core team is distributed throughout the US, with staff in south Florida, St. Louis, the Twin Cities, and Rochester, NY. If you happen to be in one of those places, great! If not, that's totally OK as well. We use Zoom, Slack, and email to keep in touch with each other and with clients.</li>\n<li>A core team and a deep bench: Our core team has grown from four to eight within the last 18 months, and we expect to be eleven total by mid-2021. We also work with a team of about twenty consultants on a variety of client projects. We value expertise and pay for labor. Every member of our team carries lived experience outside of dominant US macroculture.</li>\n<li>Sustainable work: While consulting doesn't always fit into 40 hours a week, we do not typically work 50 or 60-hour weeks either. We believe in sustainable work practices: we care for each other's time off, ability to close the computer, and health. Your workload will be manageable.</li>\n<li>Flexible time: Once our clients' needs are met, our time is our own to structure. Most of us work around typical daytime business hours Eastern Time, but when you need to take care of personal business or get a day off, you'll have the flexibility you need to structure your own time.</li>\n<li>Respecting boundaries: All of us have lives outside of work. When you're on vacation, we'll only contact you if things will Literally Fall Apart without you for a few days, and even that as minimally as possible. We also don't expect 24-hour communication: except in the most dire of client emergencies, email can wait until morning.</li>\n<li>Doing our own work: Just as we advise our clients, we value continuous improvement. We will support your involvement in conferences and professional communities, online courses, training, and we'll purchase materials you need to keep learning and growing. Making you better makes us better.</li>\n<li>Benefits: You'll be a full-time W-2 employee with access to a full range of benefits:</li>\n<li>Health (employer-paid for gold plan, or only pay the difference for platinum)</li>\n<li>Dental and Vision (reasonable premium)</li>\n<li>401(k), with a flat employer contribution of 4% that vests immediately</li>\n<li>Generous paid leave: 20 days vacation, up to 12 days sick, 11 holidays (exchangeable for different days), and 2 floating holidays to use as you see fit</li>\n<li>Available Life and AD&amp;D policies</li>\n</ul>\nNext steps\n<br><br>\nIf this sounds like the right fit for you, we look forward to talking with you! Please complete the application here, and we will be in touch to request further information if there might be a good match. Please attach both a cover letter and resume/CV in a single file in the Resume field.\n<br><br>\nThank you for considering a role with DJA!</div><div id=\"belowFullJobDescription\" class=\"mosaic mosaic-empty-zone\"></div>",

IZEA launched the industry's first-ever influencer marketing platform in 2006 and has since facilitated nearly 4 million transactions between online buyers and sellers.</p><p>\nLeading brands and agencies partner with IZEA to increase digital engagement, diversify brand voice, scale content production, and drive highly measurable return on investment.</p><p>\nIZEA is a microcap public company traded on NASDAQ.

We push each other, learn from each other, and strive to continually grow.</p><p><b>\nCandidate Location</b></p><p>\nIZEA is headquartered in Orlando, Florida though the company is currently 100% remote due to COVID-19.

We provide an income streaming solution for employers to give employees instant access to their earnings, and prevent them ever having to go into debt between pay cycles.</p><p>\nWe were founded for a social purpose to reduce the poverty premium. We believe the monthly pay cycle is fundamentally broken and unfair to employees, and that we can fix it. We know financial services are better served through the employer, and have built a set of tools [track, stream, save, learn], that boost the financial resilience of a workforce and have a measurable and proven impact on employee retention and productivity.</p><p>\nWe love our clients and do everything we can to support them. We already help 350,000 employees access their income when they need it, across some of the largest organisations in the UK including the NHS, Bupa, Holland &amp; Barrett, Stonegate Pubs and Rentokil. In July 2020, Wagestream raised additional funding to expand into new markets in Europe and North America. Our mission is to provide fair financial services to all and our technology has started to create a whole new category; the workplace bank.</p><p></p><br>\n<p><b>\nSenior Software Engineer - Applications</b></p><p>\nWagestream moves money. We currently move tens of millions of currency per month, and at current growth rates that will measure in the billions within the next 12 months. Importantly, this is not just a few credit card payments or bills - this is people's wages, it's their livelihood, so we take our payment responsibility very seriously.</p><p>\nThe Core Banking team is responsible for maintaining our US, UK, EU and AU infrastructure. In general, those the global payment schemes work amazingly well, but when processing hundreds of thousands of transactions, there are always exceptions. The Core Banking team makes sure that our platform flags those exceptions and recovers from all possibly failure modes automatically.</p><p>\nWe release multiple times per day, so you'll need to be comfortable owning features from concept, to release, to post-release measurement. The technology stack is a backend of AWS+Python+Postgres, and a frontend of vue.js, but experience with those particular technologies is not required. You should however, have a proven track-record of shipping web and mobile applications.<br>\n</p><p></p><h3 class=\"jobSectionHeader\"><b>\nKey Responsibilities</b></h3><ul>\n<li>Work with stakeholders to define new features for employees and employers</li>\n<li>Architect, test, and release new features (ideally to a subset of our total audience)</li>\n<li>Work with data science team to analyse effectiveness, and tweak where necessary</li>\n<li>\"Push the button\" and release your creation into the wild</li>\n<li>Contribute to the broader engineering team (best practices, tools, technologies)</li><br>\n</ul><br>\n<h3 class=\"jobSectionHeader\"><b>About You</b></h3><ul>\n<li>You are full-stack.</li>\n<li>You look at the full picture to understand the value and impact of what you are building by talking to customers (internal, external)</li>\n<li>You are data-driven and rigorously analyse and measure the performance of features to unearth opportunities to improve.</li>\n<li>You thrive on building what users and clients need, not just what they want, so you research, analyse, and think long-term.</li>\n<li>You realise that products are created by teams, not by individuals. And, what matters is what gets done, not who did it.</li>\n<li>You’ll get kicks out of generating great ideas which might improve the daily lives of everyone who uses our service.</li>\n<li>You constantly battle with the \"<i>Building The Right Product\"</i> and \"<i>Building The Product Right\"</i> argument - it keeps you honest, and in-tune with the value you produce.</li>\n<li>You shape what you build through active contribution in product conversations and provide a strong technical voice to solving end-user needs</li>\n</ul><p><b>Requirements</b></p><p><b>\nWhat experience would we expect you to have?\n</b></p><p><i>(But if you’re close… that’s still a conversation we would like to have!)</i></p><ul>\n<li>7+ years experience in professional software engineering</li>\n<li>Mastery of at least one modern web/mobile framework.
