We seek people who naturally demonstrate our values, who are challenged by problems, empower others to thrive, people who can draw the owl and not be beholden to one playbook.</p>\n<h2><strong>About us:</strong></h2>\n<p>Millions of developers around the world have used Twilio to unlock the magic of communications to improve any human experience. Twilio has democratized communications channels like voice, text, chat, video and email by virtualizing the world’s communications infrastructure through APIs that are simple enough for any developer to use, yet robust enough to power the world’s most demanding applications.

We're aiming to change the landscape of modern web development.&nbsp;</span>\n<p>We recently raised $53M in Series C funding to bring forward the next generation of tooling for a more accessible web. This round was led by the EQT Ventures with participation from existing investors Andreessen Horowitz &amp; Kleiner Perkins. This brings Netlify’s funding raised in total to $97M to date. Other past investors include Bloomberg Beta, Designer Fund, and Tank Hill Ventures, as well as the founders of Figma, GitHub, Slack and Yelp.</p>\n<p>Netlify is a diverse group of incredible talent from all over the world.

We get it. That’s why we want all of our Gurus to feel a sense of belonging that comes from feeling supported in all areas of their lives. Everyone has family, friends and interests outside of their careers, so we offer perks and benefits to make work, work better for you.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>4 weeks PTO, plus 10 sick days, and holidays.</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Because even when your office is your living room, we all need time to unplug.</span></li>\n<li><strong>Remotely awesome.</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Get $500 to level up your home office, monthly snack boxes, free Headspace access, weekly lunch funds, and $50 monthly for internet.</span></li>\n<li><strong>Human connection. </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get to know the Gurus with good times and get-togethers inspired by our values, virtual happy hours, lunchtime trivia, or a socially distanced drive-in movie.</span></li>\n<li><strong>Gender-neutral paid parental leave.</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Expanding your family? We offer 12 weeks of gender-neutral paid parental leave, and reimburse up to $10,000 for eligible adoption expenses.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>$1,000 continuing education budget.</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> All Gurus get $250 a quarter to spend on personal development, and 2 hours each week reserved for learning something new.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong data-stringify-type=\"bold\">Remote where?</strong></span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The A Cloud Guru team has grown a lot since it was just two brothers with a dream of teaching the world to cloud! We now employ gurus in 30 states of the USA as well as in Australia and the UK. For the time being that’s as far as we can go. We won’t bore you with the details, but setting up the extra operations we would need to employ people in new states or countries is a little bit more expensive than replicating your database in another AZ, if you know what we mean. So as much as we would love to have staff in as many countries as we have students, we are only opening this role to applicants in areas we currently have operations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re not sure if your US state is included, please still apply! We will let you know if you are in a state that we currently don’t have operations. If anything changes we will reach back out.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>What’s the interview process like at ACG?</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Applying for a job can feel intimidating and like a full-time job of its own. You shouldn’t have to burn through a week of sick time or all your best out-of-office excuses just to put feelers out for a new career opportunity. We want to be as transparent about the process as possible to help ease your mind. It’s our goal to provide you a fair, efficient interviewing experience that respects you and your time — and to do it all with a sidecar of delight.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you submit an application, we’ll review it.&nbsp;If you’re a good fit, you’ll have an initial chat with a recruiter over the phone. A phone interview with a manager typically follows. Depending on your role, you might then be asked to do a little homework (but nothing too time consuming). </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then we’ll schedule a Zoom call to meet other members of the team, answer any questions you have, and give you a feel for what it’s really like to work at ACG. If you're on the fence, just give it a try.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep being awesome, Cloud Gurus.</span></p>",
